2,40.42857142857143,11603,287,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful alif lām meem this is the book about which there is no doubt a guidance for those conscious of allāh who believe in the unseen establish prayer and spend out of what we have provided for them and who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and of the hereafter they are certain those are upon guidance from their lord and it is those who are the successful indeed those who disbelieve it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe allāh has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and over their vision is a veil and for them is a great punishment and of the people are some who say ""we believe in allāh and the last day"" but they are not believers they deceive allāh and those who believe but they deceive not except themselves and perceive not in their hearts is disease so allāh has increased their disease and for them is a painful punishment because they used to lie and when it is said to them ""do not cause corruption on the earth"" they say ""we are but reformers"" unquestionably it is they who are the corrupters but they perceive not and when it is said to them ""believe as the people have believed"" they say ""should we believe as the foolish have believed?"" unquestionably it is they who are the foolish but they know not and when they meet those who believe they say ""we believe"" but when they are alone with their evil ones they say ""indeed we are with you we were only mockers"" allāh mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression they wander blindly those are the ones who have purchased error for guidance so their transaction has brought no profit nor were they guided their example is that of one who kindled a fire but when it illuminated what was around him allāh took away their light and left them in darkness they could not see deaf dumb and blind so they will not return or like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness thunder and lightning they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death but allāh is encompassing of the disbelievers the lightning almost snatches away their sight every time it lights for them they walk therein but when darkness comes over them they stand and if allāh had willed he could have taken away their hearing and their sight indeed allāh is over all things competent o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you that you may become righteous who made for you the earth a bed and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you so do not attribute to allāh equals while you know and if you are in doubt about what we have sent down upon our servant then produce a sūrah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than allāh if you should be truthful but if you do not and you will never be able to then fear the fire whose fuel is people and stones prepared for the disbelievers and give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom they will say ""this is what we were provided with before"" and it is given to them in likeness and they will have therein purified spouses and they will abide therein eternally indeed allāh is not timid to present an example that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it and those who have believed know that it is the truth from their lord but as for those who disbelieve they say ""what did allāh intend by this as an example?"" he misleads many thereby and guides many thereby and he misleads not except the defiantly disobedient who break the covenant of allāh after contracting it and sever that which allāh has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth it is those who are the losers how can you disbelieve in allāh when you were lifeless and he brought you to life then he will cause you to die then he will bring you to life and then to him you will be returned it is he who created for you all of that which is on the earth then he directed himself to the heaven and made them seven heavens and he is knowing of all things and when your lord said to the angels ""indeed i will make upon the earth a successive authority"" they said ""will you place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood while we exalt you with praise and declare your perfection?"" he said ""indeed i know that which you do not know"" and he taught adam the names all of them then he showed them to the angels and said ""inform me of the names of these if you are truthful"" they said ""exalted are you we have no knowledge except what you have taught us indeed it is you who is the knowing the wise"" he said ""o adam inform them of their names"" and when he had informed them of their names he said ""did i not tell you that i know the unseen of the heavens and the earth? and i know what you reveal and what you have concealed"" and when we said to the angels ""prostrate before adam"" so they prostrated except for iblees he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers and we said ""o adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat therefrom in abundance from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers"" but satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that in which they had been and we said ""go down as enemies to one another and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time"" then adam received from his lord words and he accepted his repentance indeed it is he who is the accepting of repentance the merciful we said ""go down from it all of you and when guidance comes to you from me whoever follows my guidance there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve and those who disbelieve and deny our signs those will be companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally"" o children of israel remember my favor which i have bestowed upon you and fulfill my covenant that i will fulfill your covenant and be afraid of me and believe in what i have sent down confirming that which is with you and be not the first to disbelieve in it and do not exchange my signs for a small price and fear me and do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know and establish prayer and give zakāh and bow with those who bow do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the scripture? then will you not reason? and seek help through patience and prayer and indeed it is difficult except for the humbly submissive who are certain that they will meet their lord and that they will return to him o children of israel remember my favor that i have bestowed upon you and that i preferred you over the worlds and fear a day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will compensation be taken from it nor will they be aided and when we saved you from the people of pharaoh who afflicted you with the worst torment slaughtering your sons and keeping your females alive and in that was a great trial from your lord and when we parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of pharaoh while you were looking on and when we made an appointment with moses for forty nights then you took the calf after him while you were wrongdoers then we forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful and when we gave moses the scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided and when moses said to his people ""o my people indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf so repent to your creator and kill yourselves that is best for you in the sight of your creator"" then he accepted your repentance indeed he is the accepting of repentance the merciful and when you said ""o moses we will never believe you until we see allāh outright"" so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on then we revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful and we shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails ""eat from the good things with which we have provided you"" and they wronged us not but they were wronging themselves and when we said ""enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in abundance and enter the gate bowing humbly and say 'relieve us of our burdens ' we will forgive your sins for you and we will increase the doers of good "" but those who wronged changed to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying and when moses prayed for water for his people so we said ""strike with your staff the stone"" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs and every people knew its watering place ""eat and drink from the provision of allāh and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption"" and when you said ""o moses we can never endure one food so call upon your lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions"" said ""would you exchange what is better for what is less? go into settlement and indeed you will have what you have asked"" and they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from allāh that was because they disbelieved in the signs of allāh and killed the prophets without right that was because they disobeyed and were transgressing indeed those who believed and those who were jews or christians or sabeans  those who believed in allāh and the last day and did righteousness will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve and when we took your covenant and we raised over you the mount ""take what we have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous"" then you turned away after that and if not for the favor of allāh upon you and his mercy you would have been among the losers and you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath and we said to them ""be apes despised"" and we made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded and a lesson for those who fear allāh and when moses said to his people ""indeed allāh commands you to slaughter a cow"" they said ""do you take us in ridicule?"" he said ""i seek refuge in allāh from being among the ignorant"" they said ""call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is"" said "" says 'it is a cow which is neither old nor virgin but median between that' so do what you are commanded"" they said ""call upon your lord to show us what is her color"" he said ""he says 'it is a yellow cow bright in color pleasing to the observers'"" they said ""call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is indeed cows look alike to us and indeed we if allāh wills will be guided"" he said ""he says 'it is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field one free from fault with no spot upon her'"" they said ""now you have come with the truth"" so they slaughtered her but they could hardly do it and when you slew a man and disputed over it but allāh was to bring out that which you were concealing so we said ""strike him with part of it"" thus does allāh bring the dead to life and he shows you his signs that you might reason then your hearts became hardened after that being like stones or even harder for indeed there are stones from which rivers burst forth and there are some of them that split open and water comes out and there are some of them that fall down for fear of allāh and allāh is not unaware of what you do do you covet that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of allāh and then distort it after they had understood it while they were knowing? and when they meet those who believe they say ""we have believed"" but when they are alone with one another they say ""do you talk to them about what allāh has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your lord?"" then will you not reason? but do they not know that allāh knows what they conceal and what they declare? and among them are unlettered ones who do not know the scripture except wishful thinking but they are only assuming so woe to those who write the ""scripture"" with their own hands then say ""this is from allāh"" in order to exchange it for a small price woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn and they say ""never will the fire touch us except for numbered days"" say ""have you taken a covenant with allāh? for allāh will never break his covenant or do you say about allāh that which you do not know?"" yes whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally but they who believe and do righteous deeds those are the companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally and when we took the covenant from the children of israel ""do not worship except allāh and to parents do good and to relatives orphans and the needy and speak to people good and establish prayer and give zakāh"" then you turned away except a few of you and you were refusing and when we took your covenant ""do not shed your blood or evict one another from your homes"" then you acknowledged while you were witnessing then you are those killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes cooperating against them in sin and aggression and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although their eviction was forbidden to you so do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part? then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life and on the day of resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment and allāh is not unaware of what you do those are the ones who have bought the life of this world for the hereafter so the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be aided and we did certainly give moses the scripture and followed up after him with messengers and we gave jesus the son of mary clear proofs and supported him with the pure spirit but is it that every time a messenger came to you with what your souls did not desire you were arrogant? and a party you denied and another party you killed and they said ""our hearts are wrapped"" but allāh has cursed them for their disbelief so little is it that they believe and when there came to them a book from allāh confirming that which was with them although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved but when there came to them that which they recognized they disbelieved in it so the curse of allāh will be upon the disbelievers how wretched is that for which they sold themselves that they would disbelieve in what allāh has revealed through outrage that allāh would send down his favor upon whom he wills from among his servants so they returned having wrath upon wrath and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment and when it is said to them ""believe in what allāh has revealed"" they say ""we believe in what was revealed to us"" and they disbelieve in what came after it while it is the truth confirming that which is with them say ""then why did you kill the prophets of allāh before if you are believers?"" and moses had certainly brought you clear proofs then you took the calf after that while you were wrongdoers and when we took your covenant and raised over you the mount ""take what we have given you with determination and listen"" they said ""we hear and disobey"" and their hearts absorbed the calf because of their disbelief say ""how wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you if you should be believers"" say ""if the home of the hereafter with allāh is for you alone and not the people then wish for death if you should be truthful"" but never will they wish for it ever because of what their hands have put forth and allāh is knowing of the wrongdoers and you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life  more than those who associate others with allāh one of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years but it would not remove him in the least from the punishment that he should be granted life and allāh is seeing of what they do say ""whoever is an enemy to gabriel it is he who has brought it down upon your heart by permission of allāh confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers"" whoever is an enemy to allāh and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael then indeed allāh is an enemy to the disbelievers and we have certainly revealed to you verses clear proofs and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient is it not that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? but most of them do not believe and when a messenger from allāh came to them confirming that which was with them a party of those who had been given the scripture threw the scripture of allāh behind their backs as if they did not know and they followed what the devils had recited during the reign of solomon it was not solomon who disbelieved but the devils disbelieved teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at babylon hārūt and mārūt but they do not teach anyone unless they say ""we are a trial so do not disbelieve "" and they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife but they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of allāh and they learn what harms them and does not benefit them but they certainly knew that whoever purchased it would not have in the hereafter any share and wretched is that for which they sold themselves if they only knew and if they had believed and feared allāh then the reward from allāh would have been better if they only knew o you who have believed say not ""rāʿinā"" but say ""unẓurnā"" and listen and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment neither those who disbelieve from the people of the scripture nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your lord but allāh selects for his mercy whom he wills and allāh is the possessor of great bounty we do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that we bring forth better than it or similar to it do you not know that allāh is over all things competent? do you not know that to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and you have not besides allāh any protector or any helper? or do you intend to ask your messenger as moses was asked before? and whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way many of the people of the scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed out of envy from themselves after the truth has become clear to them so pardon and overlook until allāh delivers his command indeed allāh is over all things competent and establish prayer and give zakāh and whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with allāh indeed allāh of what you do is seeing and they say ""none will enter paradise except one who is a jew or a christian"" that is their wishful thinking say ""produce your proof if you should be truthful"" yes whoever submits his face in islām to allāh while being a doer of good will have his reward with his lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve the jews say ""the christians have nothing to stand on"" and the christians say ""the jews have nothing to stand on"" although they recite the scripture thus do those who know not speak the same as their words but allāh will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ and who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of allāh from being mentioned in his mosques and strive toward their destruction it is not for them to enter them except in fear for them in this world is disgrace and they will have in the hereafter a great punishment and to allāh belongs the east and the west so wherever you turn there is the face of allāh indeed allāh is allencompassing and knowing they say ""allāh has taken a son"" exalted is he! rather to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth all are devoutly obedient to him originator of the heavens and the earth when he decrees a matter he only says to it ""be"" and it is those who do not know say ""why does allāh not speak to us or there come to us a sign?"" thus spoke those before them like their words their hearts resemble each other we have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain indeed we have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner and you will not be asked about the companions of hellfire and never will the jews and the christians approve of you until you follow their religion say ""indeed the guidance of allāh is the guidance"" if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge you would have against allāh no protector or helper those to whom we have given the book recite it with its true recital they believe in it and whoever disbelieves in it it is they who are the losers o children of israel remember my favor which i have bestowed upon you and that i preferred you over the worlds and fear a day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided and when abraham was tried by his lord with words and he fulfilled them said ""indeed i will make you a leader for the people"" said ""and of my descendants?"" said ""my covenant does not include the wrongdoers"" and when we made the house a place of return for the people and security and take from the standing place of abraham a place of prayer and we charged abraham and ishmael ""purify my house for those who perform ṭawāf and those who are staying for worship and those who bow and prostrate "" and when abraham said ""my lord make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits whoever of them believes in allāh and the last day"" said ""and whoever disbelieves i will grant him enjoyment for a little then i will force him to the punishment of the fire and wretched is the destination"" and when abraham was raising the foundations of the house and ishmael ""our lord accept from us indeed you are the hearing the knowing our lord and make us muslims to you and from our descendants a muslim nation to you and show us our rites and accept our repentance indeed you are the accepting of repentance the merciful our lord and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them your verses and teach them the book and wisdom and purify them indeed you are the exalted in might the wise"" and who would be averse to the religion of abraham except one who makes a fool of himself and we had chosen him in this world and indeed he in the hereafter will be among the righteous when his lord said to him ""submit"" he said ""i have submitted to the lord of the worlds"" and abraham instructed his sons and jacob ""o my sons indeed allāh has chosen for you this religion so do not die except while you are muslims"" or were you witnesses when death approached jacob when he said to his sons ""what will you worship after me?"" they said ""we will worship your god and the god of your fathers abraham and ishmael and isaac one god and we are muslims to him"" that was a nation which has passed on it will have what it earned and you will have what you have earned and you will not be asked about what they used to do they say ""be jews or christians you will be guided"" say ""rather the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of the polytheists"" say ""we have believed in allāh and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descendants and what was given to moses and jesus and what was given to the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and we are muslims to him"" so if they believe in the same as you believe in then they have been guided but if they turn away they are only in dissension and allāh will be sufficient for you against them and he is the hearing the knowing the religion of allāh and who is better than allāh in religion? and we are worshippers of him"" say ""do you argue with us about allāh while he is our lord and your lord? for us are our deeds and for you are your deeds and we are sincere to him"" or do you say that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descendants were jews or christians? say ""are you more knowing or is allāh?"" and who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from allāh? and allāh is not unaware of what you do that is a nation which has passed on it will have what it earned and you will have what you have earned and you will not be asked about what they used to do the foolish among the people will say ""what has turned them away from their qiblah which they used to face?"" say ""to allāh belongs the east and the west he guides whom he wills to a straight path"" and thus we have made you a median community that you will be witnesses over the people and the messenger will be a witness over you and we did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that we might make evident who would follow the messenger from who would turn back on his heels and indeed it is difficult except for those whom allāh has guided and never would allāh have caused you to lose your faith indeed allāh is to the people kind and merciful we have certainly seen the turning of your face toward the heaven and we will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased so turn your face toward almasjid alḥarām and wherever you are turn your faces toward it indeed those who have been given the scripture well know that it is the truth from their lord and allāh is not unaware of what they do and if you brought to those who were given the scripture every sign they would not follow your qiblah nor will you be a follower of their qiblah nor would they be followers of one another's qiblah so if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge indeed you would then be among the wrongdoers those to whom we gave the scripture know him as they know their own sons but indeed a party of them conceal the truth while they know the truth is from your lord so never be among the doubters for each is a direction toward which it faces so race to good wherever you may be allāh will bring you forth all together indeed allāh is over all things competent so from wherever you go out turn your face toward almasjid alḥarām and indeed it is the truth from your lord and allāh is not unaware of what you do and from wherever you go out turn your face toward almasjid alḥarām and wherever you may be turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not have any argument against you except for those of them who commit wrong so fear them not but fear me and so i may complete my favor upon you and that you may be guided just as we have sent among you a messenger from yourselves reciting to you our verses and purifying you and teaching you the book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know so remember me i will remember you and be grateful to me and do not deny me o you who have believed seek help through patience and prayer indeed allāh is with the patient and do not say about those who are killed in the way of allāh ""they are dead"" rather they are alive but you perceive not and we will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits but give good tidings to the patient who when disaster strikes them say ""indeed we belong to allāh and indeed to him we will return"" those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their lord and mercy and it is those who are the guided indeed aṣṣafā and almarwah are among the symbols of allāh so whoever makes ḥajj to the house or performs ʿumrah there is no blame upon him for walking between them and whoever volunteers good then indeed allāh is appreciative and knowing indeed those who conceal what we sent down of clear proofs and guidance after we made it clear for the people in the scripture those are cursed by allāh and cursed by those who curse except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident those i will accept their repentance and i am the accepting of repentance the merciful indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers upon them will be the curse of allāh and of the angels and the people all together abiding eternally therein the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved and your god is one god there is no deity except him the entirely merciful the especially merciful indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day and the ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people and what allāh has sent down from the heavens of rain giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every moving creature and directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and earth are signs for a people who use reason and among the people are those who take other than allāh as equals they love them as they love allāh but those who believe are stronger in love for allāh and if only they who have wronged would consider when they see the punishment that all power belongs to allāh and that allāh is severe in punishment when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed and they see the punishment and cut off from them are the ties those who followed will say ""if only we had another turn so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us"" thus will allāh show them their deeds as regrets upon them and they are never to emerge from the fire o mankind eat from whatever is on earth lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy he only orders you to evil and immorality and to say about allāh what you do not know and when it is said to them ""follow what allāh has revealed"" they say ""rather we will follow that which we found our fathers doing"" even though their fathers understood nothing nor were they guided? the example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries  deaf dumb and blind so they do not understand o you who have believed eat from the good things which we have provided for you and be grateful to allāh if it is him that you worship he has only forbidden to you dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allāh but whoever is forced neither desiring nor transgressing there is no sin upon him indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful indeed they who conceal what allāh has sent down of the book and exchange it for a small price those consume not into their bellies except the fire and allāh will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them and they will have a painful punishment those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment how patient they are for the fire! that is because allāh has sent down the book in truth and indeed those who differ over the book are in extreme dissension righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west but righteousness is one who believes in allāh the last day the angels the book and the prophets and gives wealth in spite of love for it to relatives orphans the needy the traveler those who ask and for freeing slaves establishes prayer and gives zakāh fulfill their promise when they promise and are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle those are the ones who have been true and it is those who are the righteous o you who have believed prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered the free for the free the slave for the slave and the female for the female but whoever overlooks from his brother anything then there should be a suitable followup and payment to him with good conduct this is an alleviation from your lord and a mercy but whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment and there is for you in legal retribution life o you of understanding that you may become righteous prescribed for you when death approaches one of you if he leaves wealth a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable a duty upon the righteous then whoever alters it after he has heard it the sin is only upon those who have altered it indeed allāh is hearing and knowing but if one fears from the bequeather error or sin and corrects that which is between them there is no sin upon him indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful o you who have believed decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous a limited number of days so whoever among you is ill or on a journey  then an equal number of other days and upon those who are able  a ransom of feeding a poor person and whoever volunteers good  it is better for him but to fast is best for you if you only knew the month of ramaḍān in which was revealed the qur’ān a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion so whoever sights the month let him fast it and whoever is ill or on a journey then an equal number of other days allāh intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and for you to complete the period and to glorify allāh for that which he has guided you and perhaps you will be grateful and when my servants ask you concerning me indeed i am near i respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon me so let them respond to me and believe in me that they may be guided it has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives they are a clothing for you and you are a clothing for them allāh knows that you used to deceive yourselves so he accepted your repentance and forgave you so now have relations with them and seek that which allāh has decreed for you and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread then complete the fast until the night and do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques these are the limits allāh so do not approach them thus does allāh make clear his verses to the people that they may become righteous and do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it to the rulers in order that you consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin while you know they ask you about the crescent moons say ""they are measurements of time for the people and for ḥajj "" and it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back but righteousness is one who fears allāh and enter houses from their doors and fear allāh that you may succeed fight in the way of allāh those who fight against you but do not transgress indeed allāh does not like transgressors and kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you and fitnah is worse than killing and do not fight them at almasjid alḥarām until they fight you there but if they fight you then kill them such is the recompense of the disbelievers and if they cease then indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful fight them until there is no fitnah and religion is for allāh but if they cease then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors the sacred month is for the sacred month and for violations is legal retribution so whoever has assaulted you then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you and fear allāh and know that allāh is with those who fear him and spend in the way of allāh and do not throw with your hands into destruction and do good indeed allāh loves the doers of good and complete the ḥajj and ʿumrah for allāh but if you are prevented then what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter and whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head a ransom of fasting or charity or sacrifice and when you are secure then whoever performs ʿumrah followed by ḥajj what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals and whoever cannot find  then a fast of three days during ḥajj and of seven when you have returned those are ten complete this is for those whose family is not in the area of almasjid alḥarām and fear allāh and know that allāh is severe in penalty ḥajj is wellknown months so whoever has made ḥajj obligatory upon himself therein there is no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during ḥajj and whatever good you do allāh knows it and take provisions but indeed the best provision is fear of allāh and fear me o you of understanding there is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your lord but when you depart from ʿarafāt remember allāh at almashʿar alḥarām and remember him as he has guided you for indeed you were before that among those astray then depart from the place from where the people depart and ask forgiveness of allāh indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful and when you have completed your rites remember allāh like your remembrance of your fathers or with greater remembrance and among the people is he who says ""our lord give us in this world"" and he will have in the hereafter no share but among them is he who says ""our lord give us in this world good and in the hereafter good and protect us from the punishment of the fire"" those will have a share of what they have earned and allāh is swift in account and remember allāh during numbered days then whoever hastens in two days there is no sin upon him and whoever delays  there is no sin upon him for him who fears allāh and fear allāh and know that unto him you will be gathered and of the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life and he calls allāh to witness as to what is in his heart yet he is the fiercest of opponents and when he goes away he strives throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and animals and allāh does not like corruption and when it is said to him ""fear allāh"" pride in the sin takes hold of him sufficient for him is hellfire and how wretched is the resting place and of the people is he who sells himself seeking means to the approval of allāh and allāh is kind to servants o you who have believed enter into islām completely and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy but if you slip after clear proofs have come to you then know that allāh is exalted in might and wise do they await but that allāh should come to them in covers of clouds and the angels and the matter is decided? and to allāh matters are returned ask the children of israel how many a sign of evidence we have given them and whoever exchanges the favor of allāh after it has come to him then indeed allāh is severe in penalty beautified for those who disbelieve is the life of this world and they ridicule those who believe but those who fear allāh are above them on the day of resurrection and allāh gives provision to whom he wills without account mankind was one religion then allāh sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed and none differed over it except those who were given it after the clear proofs came to them out of jealous animosity among themselves and allāh guided those who believed to the truth concerning that over which they had differed by his permission and allāh guides whom he wills to a straight path or do you think that you will enter paradise while such has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? they were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until messenger and those who believed with him said ""when is the help of allāh?"" unquestionably the help of allāh is near they ask you what they should spend say ""whatever you spend of good is for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler and whatever you do of good indeed allāh is knowing of it"" battle has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you but perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you and allāh knows while you know not they ask you about the sacred month about fighting therein say ""fighting therein is great but averting from the way of allāh and disbelief in him and almasjid alḥarām and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater in the sight of allāh and fitnah is greater than killing"" and they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able and whoever of you reverts from his religion and dies while he is a disbeliever for those their deeds have become worthless in this world and the hereafter and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally indeed those who have believed and those who have emigrated and fought in the cause of allāh those expect the mercy of allāh and allāh is forgiving and merciful they ask you about wine and gambling say ""in them is great sin and benefit for people but their sin is greater than their benefit"" and they ask you what they should spend say ""the excess "" thus allāh makes clear to you the verses that you might give thought to this world and the hereafter and they ask you about orphans say ""improvement for them is best and if you mix your affairs with theirs they are your brothers and allāh knows the corrupter from the amender and if allāh had willed he could have put you in difficulty indeed allāh is exalted in might and wise"" and do not marry polytheistic women until they believe and a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist even though she might please you and do not marry polytheistic men until they believe and a believing slave is better than a polytheist even though he might please you those invite to the fire but allāh invites to paradise and to forgiveness by his permission and he makes clear his verses to the people that perhaps they may remember and they ask you about menstruation say ""it is harm so keep away from wives during menstruation and do not approach them until they are pure and when they have purified themselves then come to them from where allāh has ordained for you indeed allāh loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves"" your wives are a place of cultivation for you so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth for yourselves and fear allāh and know that you will meet him and give good tidings to the believers and do not make allāh an excuse against being righteous and fearing allāh and making peace among people and allāh is hearing and knowing allāh does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths but he imposes blame upon you for what your hearts have earned and allāh is forgiving and forbearing for those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months but if they return  then indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful and if they decide on divorce then indeed allāh is hearing and knowing divorced women remain in waiting for three periods and it is not lawful for them to conceal what allāh has created in their wombs if they believe in allāh and the last day and their husbands have more right to take them back in this if they want reconciliation and due to them is similar to what is expected of them according to what is reasonable but the men have a degree over them and allāh is exalted in might and wise divorce is twice then either keep in an acceptable manner or release with good treatment and it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep the limits of allāh but if you fear that they will not keep the limits of allāh then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself these are the limits of allāh so do not transgress them and whoever transgresses the limits of allāh it is those who are the wrongdoers and if he has divorced her then she is not lawful to him afterward until she marries a husband other than him and if he divorces her there is no blame upon them for returning to each other if they think that they can keep the limits of allāh these are the limits of allāh which he makes clear to a people who know and when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms and do not keep them intending harm to transgress and whoever does that has certainly wronged himself and do not take the verses of allāh in jest and remember the favor of allāh upon you and what has been revealed to you of the book and wisdom by which he instructs you and fear allāh and know that allāh is knowing of all things and when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term do not prevent them from remarrying their husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis that is instructed to whoever of you believes in allāh and the last day that is better for you and purer and allāh knows and you know not mothers may nurse their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing upon the father is their provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable no person is charged with more than his capacity no mother should be harmed through her child and no father through his child and upon the heir is like that and if they both desire weaning through mutual consent from both of them and consultation there is no blame upon either of them and if you wish to have your children nursed by a substitute there is no blame upon you as long as you give payment according to what is acceptable and fear allāh and know that allāh is seeing of what you do and those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind they wait four months and ten and when they have fulfilled their term then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner and allāh is aware of what you do there is no blame upon you for that to which you allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves allāh knows that you will have them in mind but do not promise them secretly except for saying a proper saying and do not determine to undertake a marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end and know that allāh knows what is within yourselves so beware of him and know that allāh is forgiving and forbearing there is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation but give them compensation the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability a provision according to what is acceptable a duty upon the doers of good and if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them an obligation then half of what you specified unless they forego the right or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it and to forego it is nearer to righteousness and do not forget graciousness between you indeed allāh of whatever you do is seeing maintain with care the prayers and the middle prayer and stand before allāh devoutly obedient and if you fear on foot or riding but when you are secure then remember allāh as he has taught you that which you did not know and those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind for their wives is a bequest maintenance for one year without turning out but if they leave then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable way and allāh is exalted in might and wise and for divorced women is a provision according to what is acceptable a duty upon the righteous thus does allāh make clear to you his verses that you might use reason have you not considered those who left their homes in many thousands fearing death? allāh said to them ""die"" then he restored them to life and allāh is the possessor of bounty for the people but most of the people do not show gratitude and fight in the cause of allāh and know that allāh is hearing and knowing who is it that would loan allāh a goodly loan so he may multiply it for him many times over? and it is allāh who withholds and grants abundance and to him you will be returned have you not considered the assembly of the children of israel after moses when they said to a prophet of theirs ""send to us a king and we will fight in the way of allāh""? he said ""would you perhaps refrain from fighting if battle was prescribed for you?"" they said ""and why should we not fight in the cause of allāh when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?"" but when battle was prescribed for them they turned away except for a few of them and allāh is knowing of the wrongdoers and their prophet said to them ""indeed allāh has sent to you saul as a king"" they said ""how can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?"" he said ""indeed allāh has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature and allāh gives his sovereignty to whom he wills and allāh is allencompassing and knowing"" and their prophet said to them ""indeed a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance from your lord and a remnant of what the family of moses and the family of aaron had left carried by the angels indeed in that is a sign for you if you are believers"" and when saul went forth with the soldiers he said ""indeed allāh will be testing you with a river so whoever drinks from it is not of me and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me excepting one who takes in the hollow of his hand"" but they drank from it except a few of them then when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him they said ""there is no power for us today against goliath and his soldiers"" but those who were certain that they would meet allāh said ""how many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of allāh and allāh is with the patient"" and when they went forth to goliath and his soldiers they said ""our lord pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people"" so they defeated them by permission of allāh and david killed goliath and allāh gave him the kingship and wisdom and taught him from that which he willed and if it were not for allāh checking people by means of others the earth would have been corrupted but allāh is the possessor of bounty for the worlds these are the verses of allāh which we recite to you in truth and indeed you are from among the messengers those messengers some of them we caused to exceed others among them were those to whom allāh spoke and he raised some of them in degree and we gave jesus the son of mary clear proofs and we supported him with the pure spirit if allāh had willed those succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them but they differed and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved and if allāh had willed they would not have fought each other but allāh does what he intends o you who have believed spend from that which we have provided for you before there comes a day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession and the disbelievers they are the wrongdoers allāh there is no deity except him the everliving the selfsustaining neither drowsiness overtakes him nor sleep to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth who is it that can intercede with him except by his permission? he knows what is before them and what will be after them and they encompass not a thing of his knowledge except for what he wills his kursī extends over the heavens and the earth and their preservation tires him not and he is the most high the most great there shall be no compulsion in the religion the right course has become distinct from the wrong so whoever disbelieves in ṭāghūt and believes in allāh has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it and allāh is hearing and knowing allāh is the ally of those who believe he brings them out from darknesses into the light and those who disbelieve their allies are ṭāghūt they take them out of the light into darknesses those are the companions of the fire they will abide eternally therein have you not considered the one who argued with abraham about his lord because allāh had given him kingship? when abraham said ""my lord is the one who gives life and causes death"" he said ""i give life and cause death"" abraham said ""indeed allāh brings up the sun from the east so bring it up from the west"" so the disbeliever was overwhelmed and allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people or as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin he said ""how will allāh bring this to life after its death?"" so allāh caused him to die for a hundred years then he revived him he said ""how long have you remained?"" he said ""i have remained a day or part of a day"" he said ""rather you have remained one hundred years look at your food and your drink it has not changed with time and look at your donkey and we will make you a sign for the people and look at the bones  how we raise them and then we cover them with flesh"" and when it became clear to him he said ""i know that allāh is over all things competent"" and when abraham said ""my lord show me how you give life to the dead"" said ""have you not believed?"" he said ""yes but only that my heart may be satisfied"" said ""take four birds and commit them to yourself then put on each hill a portion of them then call them they will come to you in haste and know that allāh is exalted in might and wise"" the example of those who spend their wealth in the way of allāh is like a seed which grows seven spikes in each spike is a hundred grains and allāh multiplies for whom he wills and allāh is allencompassing and knowing those who spend their wealth in the way of allāh and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders or injury will have their reward with their lord and there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury and allāh is free of need and forbearing o you who have believed do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth to be seen by the people and does not believe in allāh and the last day his example is like that of a smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare they are unable anything of what they have earned and allāh does not guide the disbelieving people and the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of allāh and assuring themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour so it yields its fruits in double and if it is not hit by a downpour then a drizzle and allāh of what you do is seeing would one of you like to have a garden of palm trees and grapevines underneath which rivers flow in which he has from every fruit? but he is afflicted with old age and has weak offspring and it is hit by a whirlwind containing fire and is burned thus does allāh make clear to you verses that you might give thought o you who have believed spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which we have produced for you from the earth and do not aim toward the defective therefrom spending while you would not take it except with closed eyes and know that allāh is free of need and praiseworthy satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality while allāh promises you forgiveness from him and bounty and allāh is allencompassing and knowing he gives wisdom to whom he wills and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good and none will remember except those of understanding and whatever you spend of expenditures or make of vows indeed allāh knows of it and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers if you disclose your charitable expenditures they are good but if you conceal them and give them to the poor it is better for you and he will remove from you some of your misdeeds and allāh of what you do is aware not upon you is their guidance but allāh guides whom he wills and whatever good you spend is for yourselves and you do not spend except seeking the face of allāh and whatever you spend of good it will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged for the poor who have been restricted for the cause of allāh unable to move about in the land an ignorant would think them selfsufficient because of their restraint but you will know them by their sign they do not ask people persistently and whatever you spend of good indeed allāh is knowing of it those who spend their wealth by night and by day secretly and publicly they will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve those who consume interest cannot stand except as one stands who is being beaten by satan into insanity that is because they say ""trade is like interest"" but allāh has permitted trade and has forbidden interest so whoever has received an admonition from his lord and desists may have what is past and his affair rests with allāh but whoever returns  those are the companions of the fire they will abide eternally therein allāh destroys interest and gives increase for charities and allāh does not like every sinning disbeliever indeed those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zakāh will have their reward with their lord and there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve o you who have believed fear allāh and give up what remains of interest if you should be believers and if you do not then be informed of a war from allāh and his messenger but if you repent you may have your principal  you do no wrong nor are you wronged and if someone is in hardship then postponement until ease but if you give charity then it is better for you if you only knew and fear a day when you will be returned to allāh then every soul will be compensated for what it earned and they will not be wronged o you who have believed when you contract a debt for a specified term write it down and let a scribe write between you in justice let no scribe refuse to write as allāh has taught him so let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate and let him fear allāh his lord and not leave anything out of it but if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself then let his guardian dictate in justice and bring to witness two witnesses from among your men and if there are not two men then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses so that if one of them errs then the other can remind her and let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon and do not be weary to write it whether it is small or large for its term that is more just in the sight of allāh and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves for there is no blame upon you if you do not write it and take witnesses when you conclude a contract let no scribe be harmed or any witness for if you do so indeed it is disobedience in you and fear allāh and allāh teaches you and allāh is knowing of all things and if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe then a security deposit taken and if one of you entrusts another then let him who is entrusted discharge his trust and let him fear allāh his lord and do not conceal testimony for whoever conceals it his heart is indeed sinful and allāh is knowing of what you do to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it allāh will bring you to account for it then he will forgive whom he wills and punish whom he wills and allāh is over all things competent the messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his lord and the believers all of them have believed in allāh and his angels and his books and his messengers ""we make no distinction between any of his messengers"" and they say ""we hear and we obey your forgiveness our lord and to you is the destination"" allāh does not charge a soul except its capacity it will have what it has gained and it will bear what it has earned ""our lord do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred our lord and lay not upon us a burden like that which you laid upon those before us our lord and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy upon us you are our protector so give us victory over the disbelieving people"""
3,33.04477611940298,6642,201,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful alif lām meem allāh there is no deity except him the everliving the selfsustaining he has sent down upon you the book in truth confirming what was before it and he revealed the torah and the gospel before as guidance for the people and he revealed the criterion indeed those who disbelieve in the verses of allāh will have a severe punishment and allāh is exalted in might the owner of retribution indeed from allāh nothing is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven it is he who forms you in the wombs however he wills there is no deity except him the exalted in might the wise it is he who has sent down to you the book in it are verses precise they are the foundation of the book and others unspecific as for those in whose hearts is deviation they will follow that of it which is unspecific seeking discord and seeking an interpretation and no one knows its interpretation except allāh but those firm in knowledge say ""we believe in it all is from our lord"" and no one will be reminded except those of understanding ""our lord let not our hearts deviate after you have guided us and grant us from yourself mercy indeed you are the bestower our lord surely you will gather the people for a day about which there is no doubt indeed allāh does not fail in his promise"" indeed those who disbelieve never will their wealth or their children avail them against allāh at all and it is they who are fuel for the fire like the custom of the people of pharaoh and those before them they denied our signs so allāh seized them for their sins and allāh is severe in penalty say to those who disbelieve ""you will be overcome and gathered together to hell and wretched is the resting place"" already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met  one fighting in the cause of allāh and another of disbelievers they saw them twice their number by eyesight but allāh supports with his victory whom he wills indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision beautified for people is the love of that which they desire of women and sons heapedup sums of gold and silver fine branded horses and cattle and tilled land that is the enjoyment of worldly life but allāh has with him the best return say ""shall i inform you of better than that? for those who fear allāh will be gardens in the presence of their lord beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and purified spouses and approval from allāh and allāh is seeing of servants those who say ""our lord indeed we have believed so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the fire"" the patient the true the obedient those who spend and those who seek forgiveness before dawn allāh witnesses that there is no deity except him and the angels and those of knowledge  maintaining in justice there is no deity except him the exalted in might the wise indeed the religion in the sight of allāh is islām and those who were given the scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves and whoever disbelieves in the verses of allāh then indeed allāh is swift in account so if they argue with you say ""i have submitted myself to allāh and those who follow me"" and say to those who were given the scripture and the unlearned ""have you submitted yourselves?"" and if they submit they are rightly guided but if they turn away then upon you is only the notification and allāh is seeing of servants those who disbelieve in the signs of allāh and kill the prophets without right and kill those who order justice from among the people give them tidings of a painful punishment they are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the hereafter and for them there will be no helpers do you not consider those who were given a portion of the scripture? they are invited to the scripture of allāh that it should arbitrate between them then a party of them turns away and they are refusing that is because they say ""never will the fire touch us except for numbered days"" and they were deluded in their religion by what they were inventing so how will it be when we assemble them for a day about which there is no doubt? and each soul will be compensated what it earned and they will not be wronged say ""o allāh owner of sovereignty you give sovereignty to whom you will and you take sovereignty away from whom you will you honor whom you will and you humble whom you will in your hand is good indeed you are over all things competent you cause the night to enter the day and you cause the day to enter the night and you bring the living out of the dead and you bring the dead out of the living and you give provision to whom you will without account "" let not believers take disbelievers as allies rather than believers and whoever does that has nothing with allāh except when taking precaution against them in prudence and allāh warns you of himself and to allāh is the destination say ""whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it allāh knows it and he knows that which is in the heavens and that which is on the earth and allāh is over all things competent the day every soul will find what it has done of good present and what it has done of evil it will wish that between itself and that was a great distance and allāh warns you of himself and allāh is kind to servants"" say ""if you should love allāh then follow me allāh will love you and forgive you your sins and allāh is forgiving and merciful"" say ""obey allāh and the messenger but if you turn away then indeed allāh does not like the disbelievers"" indeed allāh chose adam and noah and the family of abraham and the family of ʿimrān over the worlds descendants some of them from others and allāh is hearing and knowing when the wife of ʿimrān said ""my lord indeed i have pledged to you what is in my womb consecrated so accept this from me indeed you are the hearing the knowing"" but when she delivered her she said ""my lord i have delivered a female"" and allāh was most knowing of what she delivered and the male is not like the female ""and i have named her mary and i seek refuge for her in you and her descendants from satan the expelled "" so her lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of zechariah every time zechariah entered upon her in the prayer chamber he found with her provision he said ""o mary from where is this to you?"" she said ""it is from allāh indeed allāh provides for whom he wills without account"" at that zechariah called upon his lord saying ""my lord grant me from yourself a good offspring indeed you are the hearer of supplication"" so the angels called him while he was standing in prayer in the chamber ""indeed allāh gives you good tidings of john confirming a word from allāh and honorable abstaining and a prophet from among the righteous"" he said ""my lord how will i have a boy when i have reached old age and my wife is barren?"" he said ""such is allāh he does what he wills"" he said ""my lord make for me a sign"" he said ""your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three days except by gesture and remember your lord much and exalt in the evening and the morning"" and when the angels said ""o mary indeed allāh has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds o mary be devoutly obedient to your lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow "" that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you and you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be responsible for mary nor were you with them when they disputed when the angels said ""o mary indeed allāh gives you good tidings of a word from him whose name will be the messiah jesus the son of mary distinguished in this world and the hereafter and among those brought near he will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous"" she said ""my lord how will i have a child when no man has touched me?"" said ""such is allāh he creates what he wills when he decrees a matter he only says to it 'be' and it is and he will teach him writing and wisdom and the torah and the gospel and a messenger to the children of israel 'indeed i have come to you with a sign from your lord in that i design for you from clay like the form of a bird then i breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of allāh and i cure the blind and the leper and i give life to the dead by permission of allāh and i inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses indeed in that is a sign for you if you are believers and confirming what was before me of the torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you and i have come to you with a sign from your lord so fear allāh and obey me indeed allāh is my lord and your lord so worship him that is the straight path'"" but when jesus felt disbelief from them he said ""who are my supporters for allāh?"" the disciples said ""we are supporters for allāh we have believed in allāh and testify that we are muslims our lord we have believed in what you revealed and have followed the messenger so register us among the witnesses "" and they planned but allāh planned and allāh is the best of planners when allāh said ""o jesus indeed i will take you and raise you to myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the day of resurrection then to me is your return and i will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ and as for those who disbelieved i will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the hereafter and they will have no helpers"" but as for those who believed and did righteous deeds he will give them in full their rewards and allāh does not like the wrongdoers this is what we recite to you of verses and the precise message indeed the example of jesus to allāh is like that of adam he created him from dust then he said to him ""be"" and he was the truth is from your lord so do not be among the doubters then whoever argues with you about it after knowledge has come to you say ""come let us call our sons and your sons our women and your women ourselves and yourselves then supplicate earnestly and invoke the curse of allāh upon the liars "" indeed this is the true narration and there is no deity except allāh and indeed allāh is the exalted in might the wise but if they turn away then indeed allāh is knowing of the corrupters say ""o people of the scripture come to a word that is equitable between us and you that we will not worship except allāh and not associate anything with him and not take one another as lords instead of allāh"" but if they turn away then say ""bear witness that we are muslims "" o people of the scripture why do you argue about abraham while the torah and the gospel were not revealed until after him? then will you not reason? here you are those who have argued about that of which you have knowledge but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge? and allāh knows while you know not abraham was neither a jew nor a christian but he was one inclining toward truth a muslim and he was not of the polytheists indeed the most worthy of abraham among the people are those who followed him and this prophet and those who believe and allāh is the ally of the believers a faction of the people of the scripture wish they could mislead you but they do not mislead except themselves and they perceive not o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the verses of allāh while you witness ? o people of the scripture why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know ? and a faction of the people of the scripture say ""believe in that which was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day and reject it at its end that perhaps they will return and do not trust except those who follow your religion"" say ""indeed the guidance is the guidance of allāh lest someone be given like you were given or that they would argue with you before your lord?"" say ""indeed bounty is in the hand of allāh he grants it to whom he wills and allāh is allencompassing and wise"" he selects for his mercy whom he wills and allāh is the possessor of great bounty and among the people of the scripture is he who if you entrust him with a great amount he will return it to you and among them is he who if you entrust him with a coin he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him that is because they say ""there is no blame upon us concerning the unlearned"" and they speak untruth about allāh while they know but yes whoever fulfills his commitment and fears allāh then indeed allāh loves those who fear him indeed those who exchange the covenant of allāh and their oaths for a small price will have no share in the hereafter and allāh will not speak to them or look at them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them and they will have a painful punishment and indeed there is among them a party who alter the scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the scripture but it is not from the scripture and they say ""this is from allāh"" but it is not from allāh and they speak untruth about allāh while they know it is not for a human that allāh should give him the scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people ""be servants to me rather than allāh"" but ""be pious scholars of the lord because of what you have taught of the scripture and because of what you have studied"" nor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords would he order you to disbelief after you had been muslims? and when allāh took the covenant of the prophets ""whatever i give you of the scripture and wisdom and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you you believe in him and support him"" said ""have you acknowledged and taken upon that my commitment?"" they said ""we have acknowledged it"" he said ""then bear witness and i am with you among the witnesses"" and whoever turned away after that they were the defiantly disobedient so is it other than the religion of allāh they desire while to him have submitted those within the heavens and earth willingly or by compulsion and to him they will be returned? say ""we have believed in allāh and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the descendants and in what was given to moses and jesus and to the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and we are muslims to him"" and whoever desires other than islām as religion never will it be accepted from him and he in the hereafter will be among the losers how shall allāh guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and had witnessed that the messenger is true and clear signs had come to them? and allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people those their recompense will be that upon them is the curse of allāh and the angels and the people all together abiding eternally therein the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved except for those who repent after that and correct themselves for indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful indeed those who disbelieve after their belief and then increase in disbelief never will their repentance be accepted and they are the ones astray indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers never would the capacity of the earth in gold be accepted from one of them if he would ransom himself with it for those there will be a painful punishment and they will have no helpers never will you attain the good until you spend from that which you love and whatever you spend indeed allāh is knowing of it all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel had made unlawful to himself before the torah was revealed say ""so bring the torah and recite it if you should be truthful"" and whoever invents about allāh untruth after that then those are the wrongdoers say ""allāh has told the truth so follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of the polytheists"" indeed the first house established for mankind was that at bakkah  blessed and a guidance for the worlds in it are clear signs the standing place of abraham and whoever enters it shall be safe and to allāh from the people is a pilgrimage to the house for whoever is able to find thereto a way but whoever disbelieves  then indeed allāh is free from need of the worlds say ""o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the verses of allāh while allāh is witness over what you do?"" say ""o people of the scripture why do you avert from the way of allāh those who believe seeking to make it deviant while you are witnesses ? and allāh is not unaware of what you do"" o you who have believed if you obey a party of those who were given the scripture they would turn you back after your belief unbelievers and how could you disbelieve while to you are being recited the verses of allāh and among you is his messenger? and whoever holds firmly to allāh has been guided to a straight path o you who have believed fear allāh as he should be feared and do not die except as muslims and hold firmly to the rope of allāh all together and do not become divided and remember the favor of allāh upon you when you were enemies and he brought your hearts together and you became by his favor brothers and you were on the edge of a pit of the fire and he saved you from it thus does allāh make clear to you his verses that you may be guided and let there be from you a nation inviting to good enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong and those will be the successful and do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them and those will have a great punishment on the day faces will turn white and faces will turn black as for those whose faces turn black ""did you disbelieve after your belief? then taste the punishment for what you used to reject"" but as for those whose faces turn white within the mercy of allāh they will abide therein eternally these are the verses of allāh we recite them to you in truth and allāh wants no injustice to the worlds to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and to allāh will matters be returned you are the best nation produced for mankind you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in allāh if only the people of the scripture had believed it would have been better for them among them are believers but most of them are defiantly disobedient they will not harm you except for annoyance and if they fight you they will show you their backs then they will not be aided they have been put under humiliation wherever they are overtaken except for a rope from allāh and a rope from the people and they have drawn upon themselves anger from allāh and have been put under destitution that is because they disbelieved in the verses of allāh and killed the prophets without right that is because they disobeyed and transgressed they are not the same among the people of the scripture is a community standing reciting the verses of allāh during periods of the night and prostrating they believe in allāh and the last day and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds and those are among the righteous and whatever good they do never will it be denied them and allāh is knowing of the righteous indeed those who disbelieve never will their wealth or their children avail them against allāh at all and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally the example of what they spend in this worldly life is like that of a wind containing frost which strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it and allāh has not wronged them but they wrong themselves o you who have believed do not take as intimates those other than yourselves for they will not spare you ruin they wish you would have hardship hatred has already appeared from their mouths and what their breasts conceal is greater we have certainly made clear to you the signs if you will use reason here you are loving them but they are not loving you while you believe in the scripture all of it and when they meet you they say ""we believe"" but when they are alone they bite their fingertips at you in rage say ""die in your rage indeed allāh is knowing of that within the breasts"" if good touches you it distresses them but if harm strikes you they rejoice at it and if you are patient and fear allāh their plot will not harm you at all indeed allāh is encompassing of what they do and when you left your family in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle  and allāh is hearing and knowing when two parties among you were about to lose courage but allāh was their ally and upon allāh the believers should rely and already had allāh given you victory at badr while you were weak then fear allāh perhaps you will be grateful when you said to the believers ""is it not sufficient for you that your lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down? yes if you remain patient and conscious of allāh and they come upon you in rage your lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks "" and allāh made it not except as good tidings for you and to reassure your hearts thereby and victory is not except from allāh the exalted in might the wise that he might cut down a section of the disbelievers or suppress them so that they turn back disappointed not for you is the decision whether he should or forgive them or punish them for indeed they are wrongdoers and to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills and allāh is forgiving and merciful o you who have believed do not consume usury doubled and multiplied but fear allāh that you may be successful and fear the fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers and obey allāh and the messenger that you may obtain mercy and hasten to forgiveness from your lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth prepared for the righteous who spend during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people and allāh loves the doers of good and those who when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves remember allāh and seek forgiveness for their sins and who can forgive sins except allāh? and do not persist in what they have done while they know those their reward is forgiveness from their lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally and excellent is the reward of the workers similar situations have passed on before you so proceed throughout the earth and observe how was the end of those who denied this is a clear statement to the people and a guidance and instruction for those conscious of allāh so do not weaken and do not grieve and you will be superior if you are believers if a wound should touch you there has already touched the people a wound similar to it and these days we alternate among the people so that allāh may make evident those who believe and take to himself from among you martyrs and allāh does not like the wrongdoers and that allāh may purify the believers and destroy the disbelievers or do you think that you will enter paradise while allāh has not yet made evident those of you who fight in his cause and made evident those who are steadfast? and you had certainly wished for death before you encountered it and you have seen it while you were looking on muḥammad is not but a messenger messengers have passed on before him so if he was to die or be killed would you turn back on your heels ? and he who turns back on his heels will never harm allāh at all but allāh will reward the grateful and it is not for one to die except by permission of allāh at a decree determined and whoever desires the reward of this world we will give him thereof and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter we will give him thereof and we will reward the grateful and how many a prophet with him fought many religious scholars but they never lost assurance due to what afflicted them in the cause of allāh nor did they weaken or submit and allāh loves the steadfast and their words were not but that they said ""our lord forgive us our sins and the excess in our affairs and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people"" so allāh gave them the reward of this world and the good reward of the hereafter and allāh loves the doers of good o you who have believed if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back on your heels and you will become losers but allāh is your protector and he is the best of helpers we will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve for what they have associated with allāh of which he had not sent down authority and their refuge will be the fire and wretched is the residence of the wrongdoers and allāh had certainly fulfilled his promise to you when you were killing them by his permission until when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order and disobeyed after he had shown you that which you love among you are some who desire this world and among you are some who desire the hereafter then he turned you back from them that he might test you and he has already forgiven you and allāh is the possessor of bounty for the believers when you climbed without looking aside at anyone while the messenger was calling you from behind so allāh repaid you with distress upon distress so you would not grieve for that which had escaped you or that which had befallen you and allāh is aware of what you do then after distress he sent down upon you security drowsiness overcoming a faction of you while another faction worried about themselves thinking of allāh other than the truth the thought of ignorance saying ""is there anything for us in this matter?"" say ""indeed the matter belongs completely to allāh"" they conceal within themselves what they will not reveal to you they say ""if there was anything we could have done in the matter we would not have been killed right here"" say ""even if you had been inside your houses those decreed to be killed would have come out to their death beds"" so that allāh might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts and allāh is knowing of that within the breasts indeed those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met  it was satan who caused them to slip because of some they had earned but allāh has already forgiven them indeed allāh is forgiving and forbearing o you who have believed do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers when they traveled through the land or went out to fight ""if they had been with us they would not have died or have been killed"" so allāh makes that a regret within their hearts and it is allāh who gives life and causes death and allāh is seeing of what you do and if you are killed in the cause of allāh or die then forgiveness from allāh and mercy are better than whatever they accumulate and whether you die or are killed unto allāh you will be gathered so by mercy from allāh you were lenient with them and if you had been rude and harsh in heart they would have disbanded from about you so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter and when you have decided then rely upon allāh indeed allāh loves those who rely if allāh should aid you no one can overcome you but if he should forsake you who is there that can aid you after him? and upon allāh let the believers rely it is not to any prophet that he would act unfaithfully and whoever betrays will come with what he took on the day of resurrection then will every soul be compensated for what it earned and they will not be wronged so is one who pursues the pleasure of allāh like one who brings upon himself the anger of allāh and whose refuge is hell? and wretched is the destination they are degrees in the sight of allāh and allāh is seeing of whatever they do certainly did allāh confer favor upon the believers when he sent among them a messenger from themselves reciting to them his verses and purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom although they had been before in manifest error why when a disaster struck you although you had struck with one twice as great you said ""from where is this?"" say ""it is from yourselves "" indeed allāh is over all things competent and what struck you on the day the two armies met was by permission of allāh that he might make evident the believers and that he might make evident those who are hypocrites for it was said to them ""come fight in the way of allāh or defend"" they said ""if we had known battle we would have followed you"" they were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts and allāh is most knowing of what they conceal those who said about their brothers while sitting ""if they had obeyed us they would not have been killed"" say ""then prevent death from yourselves if you should be truthful"" and never think of those who have been killed in the cause of allāh as dead rather they are alive with their lord receiving provision rejoicing in what allāh has bestowed upon them of his bounty and they receive good tidings about those after them who have not yet joined them that there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve they receive good tidings of favor from allāh and bounty and that allāh does not allow the reward of believers to be lost those who responded to allāh and the messenger after injury had struck them for those who did good among them and feared allāh is a great reward those to whom people said ""indeed the people have gathered against you so fear them"" but it increased them in faith and they said ""sufficient for us is allāh and the best disposer of affairs"" so they returned with favor from allāh and bounty no harm having touched them and they pursued the pleasure of allāh and allāh is the possessor of great bounty that is only satan who frightens of his supporters so fear them not but fear me if you are believers and do not be grieved by those who hasten into disbelief indeed they will never harm allāh at all allāh intends that he should give them no share in the hereafter and for them is a great punishment indeed those who purchase disbelief for faith never will they harm allāh at all and for them is a painful punishment and let not those who disbelieve ever think that we extend their time it is better for them we only extend it for them so that they may increase in sin and for them is a humiliating punishment allāh would not leave the believers in that you are in until he separates the evil from the good nor would allāh reveal to you the unseen but allāh chooses of his messengers whom he wills so believe in allāh and his messengers and if you believe and fear him then for you is a great reward and let not those who withhold what allāh has given them of his bounty ever think that it is better for them rather it is worse for them their necks will be encircled by what they withheld on the day of resurrection and to allāh belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth and allāh of what you do is aware allāh has certainly heard the statement of those who said ""indeed allāh is poor while we are rich"" we will record what they said and their killing of the prophets without right and will say ""taste the punishment of the burning fire that is for what your hands have put forth and because allāh is not ever unjust to servants"" those who said ""indeed allāh has taken our promise not to believe any messenger until he brings us an offering which fire will consume"" say ""there have already come to you messengers before me with clear proofs and that of which you speak so why did you kill them if you should be truthful?"" then if they deny you  so were messengers denied before you who brought clear proofs and written ordinances and the enlightening scripture every soul will taste death and you will only be given your compensation on the day of resurrection so he who is drawn away from the fire and admitted to paradise has attained and what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion you will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves and you will surely hear from those who were given the scripture before you and from those who associate others with allāh much abuse but if you are patient and fear allāh indeed that is of the matters of resolve and when allāh took a covenant from those who were given the scripture ""you must make it clear to the people and not conceal it"" but they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price and wretched is that which they purchased and never think that those who rejoice in what they have perpetrated and like to be praised for what they did not do never think them in safety from the punishment and for them is a painful punishment and to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and allāh is over all things competent indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding who remember allāh while standing or sitting or on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth ""our lord you did not create this aimlessly exalted are you then protect us from the punishment of the fire our lord indeed whoever you admit to the fire you have disgraced him and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers our lord indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith 'believe in your lord' and we have believed our lord so forgive us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds and cause us to die among the righteous our lord and grant us what you promised us through your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of resurrection indeed you do not fail in promise"" and their lord responded to them ""never will i allow to be lost the work of worker among you whether male or female you are of one another so those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in my cause or fought or were killed i will surely remove from them their misdeeds and i will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from allāh and allāh has with him the best reward"" be not deceived by the movement of the disbelievers throughout the land a small enjoyment then their refuge is hell and wretched is the resting place but those who feared their lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein as accommodation from allāh and that which is with allāh is best for the righteous and indeed among the people of the scripture are those who believe in allāh and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them humbly submissive to allāh they do not exchange the verses of allāh for a small price those will have their reward with their lord indeed allāh is swift in account o you who have believed persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear allāh that you may be successful"
4,38.954802259887,6895,177,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful o mankind fear your lord who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women and fear allāh through whom you ask one another and the wombs indeed allāh is ever over you an observer and give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective for the good and do not consume their properties into your own indeed that is ever a great sin and if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls then marry those that please you of women two or three or four but if you fear that you will not be just then one or those your right hands possess that is more suitable that you may not incline and give the women their gifts graciously but if they give up willingly to you anything of it then take it in satisfaction and ease and do not give the weakminded your property which allāh has made a means of sustenance for you but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness and test the orphans until they reach marriageable age then if you perceive in them sound judgement release their property to them and do not consume it excessively and quickly that they will grow up and whoever is selfsufficient should refrain and whoever is poor let him take according to what is acceptable then when you release their property to them bring witnesses upon them and sufficient is allāh as accountant for men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave and for women is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave be it little or much an obligatory share and when relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the division then provide for them out of it and speak to them words of appropriate kindness and let those fear as if they had left weak offspring behind and feared for them so let them fear allāh and speak words of appropriate justice indeed those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire and they will be burned in a blaze allāh instructs you concerning your children for the male what is equal to the share of two females but if there are daughters two or more for them is two thirds of one's estate and if there is only one for her is half and for one's parents to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children but if he had no children and the parents inherit from him then for his mother is one third and if he had brothers for his mother is a sixth after any bequest he made or debt your parents or your children you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit an obligation by allāh indeed allāh is ever knowing and wise and for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child but if they have a child for you is one fourth of what they leave after any bequest they made or debt and for them is one fourth if you leave no child but if you leave a child then for them is an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you made or debt and if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister then for each one of them is a sixth but if they are more than two they share a third after any bequest which was made or debt as long as there is no detriment  an ordinance from allāh and allāh is knowing and forbearing these are the limits allāh and whoever obeys allāh and his messenger will be admitted by him to gardens under which rivers flow abiding eternally therein and that is the great attainment and whoever disobeys allāh and his messenger and transgresses his limits he will put him into the fire to abide eternally therein and he will have a humiliating punishment those who commit immorality of your women bring against them four from among you and if they testify confine them to houses until death takes them or allāh ordains for them way and the two who commit it among you punish them both but if they repent and correct themselves leave them alone indeed allāh is ever accepting of repentance and merciful the repentance accepted by allāh is only for those who do wrong in ignorance and then repent soon it is those to whom allāh will turn in forgiveness and allāh is ever knowing and wise but repentance is not of those who do evil deeds up until when death comes to one of them he says ""indeed i have repented now"" or of those who die while they are disbelievers for them we have prepared a painful punishment o you who have believed it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion and do not make difficulties for them in order to take part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality and live with them in kindness for if you dislike them perhaps you dislike a thing and allāh makes therein much good but if you want to replace one wife with another and you have given one of them a great amount do not take from it anything would you take it in injustice and manifest sin? and how could you take it while you have gone in unto each other and they have taken from you a solemn covenant? and do not marry those whom your fathers married except what has already occurred indeed it was an immorality and hateful and was evil as a way prohibited to you are your mothers your daughters your sisters your father's sisters your mother's sisters your brother's daughters your sister's daughters your mothers who nursed you your sisters through nursing your wives' mothers and your stepdaughters under your guardianship of your wives unto whom you have gone in but if you have not gone in unto them there is no sin upon you and the wives of your sons who are from your loins and that you take two sisters simultaneously except for what has already occurred indeed allāh is ever forgiving and merciful and married women except those your right hands possess the decree of allāh upon you and lawful to you are beyond these that you seek them with your property desiring chastity not unlawful sexual intercourse so for whatever you enjoy from them give them their due compensation as an obligation and there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree to beyond the obligation indeed allāh is ever knowing and wise and whoever among you cannot the means to marry free believing women then from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave girls and allāh is most knowing about your faith you are of one another so marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation according to what is acceptable chaste neither those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take lovers but once they are sheltered in marriage if they should commit adultery then for them is half the punishment for free women this is for him among you who fears affliction but to be patient is better for you and allāh is forgiving and merciful allāh wants to make clear to you and guide you to the practices of those before you and to accept your repentance and allāh is knowing and wise allāh wants to accept your repentance but those who follow passions want you to digress a great deviation and allāh wants to lighten for you and mankind was created weak o you who have believed do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only business by mutual consent and do not kill yourselves indeed allāh is to you ever merciful and whoever does that in aggression and injustice then we will drive him into a fire and that for allāh is easy if you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden we will remove from you your lesser sins and admit you to a noble entrance and do not wish for that by which allāh has made some of you exceed others for men is a share of what they have earned and for women is a share of what they have earned and ask allāh of his bounty indeed allāh is ever of all things knowing and for all we have made heirs to what is left by parents and relatives and to those whom your oaths have bound  give them their share indeed allāh is ever over all things a witness men are in charge of women by what allāh has given one over the other and what they spend from their wealth so righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in absence what allāh would have them guard but those from whom you fear arrogance  advise them forsake them in bed and strike them but if they obey you seek no means against them indeed allāh is ever exalted and grand and if you fear dissension between the two send an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people if they both desire reconciliation allāh will cause it between them indeed allāh is ever knowing and aware worship allāh and associate nothing with him and to parents do good and to relatives orphans the needy the near neighbor the neighbor farther away the companion at your side the traveler and those whom your right hands possess indeed allāh does not like those who are selfdeluding and boastful who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess and conceal what allāh has given them of his bounty and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment and those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the people and believe not in allāh nor in the last day and he to whom satan is a companion then evil is he as a companion and what upon them if they believed in allāh and the last day and spent out of what allāh provided for them? and allāh is ever about them knowing indeed allāh does not do injustice as much as an atom's weight while if there is a good deed he multiplies it and gives from himself a great reward so how when we bring from every nation a witness and we bring you against these as a witness? that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish they could be covered by the earth and they will not conceal from allāh a statement o you who have believed do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying or in a state of janābah except those passing through until you have washed and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands indeed allāh is ever pardoning and forgiving have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture purchasing error and wishing you would lose the way? and allāh is most knowing of your enemies and sufficient is allāh as an ally and sufficient is allāh as a helper among the jews are those who distort words from their places and say ""we hear and disobey"" and ""hear but be not heard"" and ""rāʿinā"" twisting their tongues and defaming the religion and if they had said ""we hear and obey"" and ""wait for us "" it would have been better for them and more suitable but allāh has cursed them for their disbelief so they believe not except for a few o you who were given the scripture believe in what we have sent down confirming that which is with you before we obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as we cursed the sabbathbreakers and ever is the matter of allāh accomplished indeed allāh does not forgive association with him but he forgives what is less than that for whom he wills and he who associates others with allāh has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin have you not seen those who claim themselves to be pure? rather allāh purifies whom he wills and injustice is not done to them as much as a thread look how they invent about allāh untruth and sufficient is that as a manifest sin have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture who believe in jibt and ṭāghūt and say about the disbelievers ""these are better guided than the believers as to the way""? those are the ones whom allāh has cursed and he whom allāh curses never will you find for him a helper or have they a share of dominion? then they would not give the people the speck on a date seed or do they envy people for what allāh has given them of his bounty? but we had already given the family of abraham the scripture and wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom and some among them believed in it and some among them were averse to it and sufficient is hell as a blaze indeed those who disbelieve in our verses we will drive them into a fire every time their skins are roasted through we will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment indeed allāh is ever exalted in might and wise but those who believe and do righteous deeds we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide forever for them therein are purified spouses and we will admit them to deepening shade indeed allāh commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice excellent is that which allāh instructs you indeed allāh is ever hearing and seeing o you who have believed obey allāh and obey the messenger and those in authority among you and if you disagree over anything refer it to allāh and the messenger if you should believe in allāh and the last day that is the best and best in result have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? they wish to refer legislation to ṭāghūt while they were commanded to reject it and satan wishes to lead them far astray and when it is said to them ""come to what allāh has revealed and to the messenger"" you see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion so how when disaster strikes them because of what their hands have put forth and then they come to you swearing by allāh ""we intended nothing but good conduct and accommodation"" those are the ones of whom allāh knows what is in their hearts so turn away from them but admonish them and speak to them a farreaching word and we did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of allāh and if when they wronged themselves they had come to you and asked forgiveness of allāh and the messenger had asked forgiveness for them they would have found allāh accepting of repentance and merciful but no by your lord they will not believe until they make you judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in submission and if we had decreed upon them ""kill yourselves"" or ""leave your homes"" they would not have done it except for a few of them but if they had done what they were instructed it would have been better for them and a firmer position and then we would have given them from us a great reward and we would have guided them to a straight path and whoever obeys allāh and the messenger those will be with the ones upon whom allāh has bestowed favor of the prophets the steadfast affirmers of truth the martyrs and the righteous and excellent are those as companions that is the bounty from allāh and sufficient is allāh as knower o you who have believed take your precaution and go forth in companies or go forth all together and indeed there is among you he who lingers behind and if disaster strikes you he says ""allāh has favored me in that i was not present with them"" but if bounty comes to you from allāh he will surely say as if there had never been between you and him any affection ""oh i wish i had been with them so i could have attained a great attainment"" so let those fight in the cause of allāh who sell the life of this world for the hereafter and he who fights in the cause of allāh and is killed or achieves victory we will bestow upon him a great reward and what is with you that you fight not in the cause of allāh and the oppressed among men women and children who say ""our lord take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from yourself a protector and appoint for us from yourself a helper""? those who believe fight in the cause of allāh and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of ṭāghūt so fight against the allies of satan indeed the plot of satan has ever been weak have you not seen those who were told ""restrain your hands and establish prayer and give zakāh""? but then when battle was ordained for them at once a party of them feared men as they fear allāh or with greater fear they said ""our lord why have you decreed upon us fighting? if only you had postponed us for a short time"" say ""the enjoyment of this world is little and the hereafter is better for he who fears allāh and injustice will not be done to you as much as a thread "" wherever you may be death will overtake you even if you should be within towers of lofty construction but if good comes to them they say ""this is from allāh"" and if evil befalls them they say ""this is from you"" say ""all are from allāh"" so what is with those people that they can hardly understand any statement? what comes to you of good is from allāh but what comes to you of evil is from yourself and we have sent you to the people as a messenger and sufficient is allāh as witness he who obeys the messenger has obeyed allāh but those who turn away we have not sent you over them as a guardian and they say "" obedience"" but when they leave you a group of them spend the night determining to do other than what you say but allāh records what they plan by night so leave them alone and rely upon allāh and sufficient is allāh as disposer of affairs then do they not reflect upon the qur’ān? if it had been from other than allāh they would have found within it much contradiction and when there comes to them something about security or fear they spread it around but if they had referred it back to the messenger or to those of authority among them then the ones who draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it and if not for the favor of allāh upon you and his mercy you would have followed satan except for a few so fight in the cause of allāh you are not held responsible except for yourself and encourage the believers that perhaps allāh will restrain the might of those who disbelieve and allāh is greater in might and stronger in punishment whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share therefrom and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a portion therefrom and ever is allāh over all things a keeper and when you are greeted with a greeting greet with one better than it or return it indeed allāh is ever over all things an accountant allāh there is no deity except him he will surely assemble you for the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt and who is more truthful than allāh in statement what is with you two groups concerning the hypocrites while allāh has made them fall back for what they earned do you wish to guide those whom allāh has sent astray? and he whom allāh sends astray never will you find for him a way they wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike so do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of allāh but if they turn away then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you their hearts strained at fighting you or fighting their own people and if allāh had willed he could have given them power over you and they would have fought you so if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace then allāh has not made for you a cause against them you will find others who wish to obtain security from you and obtain security from their people every time they are returned to disbelief they fall back into it so if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or restrain their hands then seize them and kill them wherever you overtake them and those we have made for you against them a clear authorization and never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake and whoever kills a believer by mistake then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment presented to his family unless they give charity but if he was from a people at war with you and he was a believer then the freeing of a believing slave and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave and whoever does not find  then a fast for two months consecutively acceptance of repentance from allāh and allāh is ever knowing and wise but whoever kills a believer intentionally his recompense is hell wherein he will abide eternally and allāh has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment o you who have believed when you go forth in the cause of allāh investigate and do not say to one who gives you peace ""you are not a believer"" aspiring for the goods of worldly life for with allāh are many acquisitions you were like that before then allāh conferred his favor upon you so investigate indeed allāh is ever of what you do aware not equal are those believers remaining  other than the disabled and the mujāhideen in the cause of allāh with their wealth and their lives allāh has preferred the mujāhideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain by degrees and to all allāh has promised the best but allāh has preferred the mujāhideen over those who remain with a great reward degrees from him and forgiveness and mercy and allāh is ever forgiving and merciful indeed those whom the angels take while wronging themselves  will say ""in what were you?"" they will say ""we were oppressed in the land"" they will say ""was not the earth of allāh spacious for you to emigrate therein?"" for those their refuge is hell and evil it is as a destination except for the oppressed among men women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way for those it is expected that allāh will pardon them and allāh is ever pardoning and forgiving and whoever emigrates for the cause of allāh will find on the earth many locations and abundance and whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to allāh and his messenger and then death overtakes him his reward has already become incumbent upon allāh and allāh is ever forgiving and merciful and when you travel throughout the land there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt you indeed the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy and when you are among them and lead them in prayer let a group of them stand with you and let them carry their arms and when they have prostrated let them be behind you and have the other group come forward which has not prayed and let them pray with you taking precaution and carrying their arms those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one attack but there is no blame upon you if you are troubled by rain or are ill for putting down your arms but take precaution indeed allāh has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment and when you have completed the prayer remember allāh standing sitting or on your sides but when you become secure reestablish prayer indeed prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times and do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy if you should be suffering so are they suffering as you are suffering but you expect from allāh that which they expect not and allāh is ever knowing and wise indeed we have revealed to you the book in truth so you may judge between the people by that which allāh has shown you and do not be for the deceitful an advocate and seek forgiveness of allāh indeed allāh is ever forgiving and merciful and do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves indeed allāh loves not one who is a habitually sinful deceiver they conceal from the people but they cannot conceal from allāh and he is with them when they spend the night in such as he does not accept of speech and ever is allāh of what they do encompassing here you are those who argue on their behalf in worldly life but who will argue with allāh for them on the day of resurrection or who will be their representative? and whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of allāh will find allāh forgiving and merciful and whoever earns a sin only earns it against himself and allāh is ever knowing and wise but whoever earns an offense or a sin and then blames it on an innocent has taken upon himself a slander and manifest sin and if it was not for the favor of allāh upon you and his mercy a group of them would have determined to mislead you but they do not mislead except themselves and they will not harm you at all and allāh has revealed to you the book and wisdom and has taught you that which you did not know and ever has the favor of allāh upon you been great no good is there in much of their private conversation except for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or conciliation between people and whoever does that seeking means to the approval of allāh then we are going to give him a great reward and whoever opposes the messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers we will give him what he has taken and drive him into hell and evil it is as a destination indeed allāh does not forgive association with him but he forgives what is less than that for whom he wills and he who associates others with allāh has certainly gone far astray they call upon instead of him none but female and they call upon none but a rebellious satan whom allāh has cursed for he had said ""i will surely take from among your servants a specific portion and i will mislead them and i will arouse in them desires and i will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle and i will command them so they will change the creation of allāh"" and whoever takes satan as an ally instead of allāh has certainly sustained a clear loss he promises them and arouses desire in them but satan does not promise them except delusion the refuge of those will be hell and they will not find from it an escape but the ones who believe and do righteous deeds we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever the promise of allāh truth and who is more truthful than allāh in statement it is not by your wishful thinking nor by that of the people of the scripture whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it and he will not find besides allāh a protector or a helper and whoever does righteous deeds whether male or female while being a believer those will enter paradise and will not be wronged the speck on a date seed and who is better in religion than one who submits himself to allāh while being a doer of good and follows the religion of abraham inclining toward truth? and allāh took abraham as an intimate friend and to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and ever is allāh of all things encompassing and they request from you a ruling concerning women say ""allāh gives you a ruling about them and what has been recited to you in the book concerning the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is decreed for them and you desire to marry them and concerning the oppressed among children and that you maintain for orphans in justice"" and whatever you do of good indeed allāh is ever knowing of it and if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them and settlement is best and present in souls is stinginess but if you do good and fear allāh then indeed allāh is ever of what you do aware and you will never be able to be equal between wives even if you should strive so do not incline completely and leave another hanging and if you amend and fear allāh then indeed allāh is ever forgiving and merciful but if they separate allāh will enrich each from his abundance and ever is allāh encompassing and wise and to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and we have instructed those who were given the scripture before you and yourselves to fear allāh but if you disbelieve then to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and ever is allāh free of need and praiseworthy and to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and sufficient is allāh as disposer of affairs if he wills he can do away with you o people and bring others and ever is allāh competent to do that whoever desires the reward of this world then with allāh is the reward of this world and the hereafter and ever is allāh hearing and seeing o you who have believed be persistently standing firm in justice witnesses for allāh even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives whether one is rich or poor allāh is more worthy of both so follow not inclination lest you not be just and if you distort or refuse then indeed allāh is ever of what you do aware o you who have believed believe in allāh and his messenger and the book that he sent down upon his messenger and the scripture which he sent down before and whoever disbelieves in allāh his angels his books his messengers and the last day has certainly gone far astray indeed those who have believed then disbelieved then believed then disbelieved and then increased in disbelief never will allāh forgive them nor will he guide them to a way give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful punishment those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers do they seek with them honor ? but indeed honor belongs to allāh entirely and it has already come down to you in the book that when you hear the verses of allāh they are denied and ridiculed so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation indeed you would then be like them indeed allāh will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in hell all together those who wait you then if you gain a victory from allāh they say ""were we not with you?"" but if the disbelievers have a success they say ""did we not gain the advantage over you but we protected you from the believers?"" allāh will judge between you on the day of resurrection and never will allāh give the disbelievers over the believers a way indeed the hypocrites deceive allāh but he is deceiving them and when they stand for prayer they stand lazily showing the people and not remembering allāh except a little wavering between them neither to these nor to those and whoever allāh sends astray never will you find for him a way o you who have believed do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers do you wish to give allāh against yourselves a clear case? indeed the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire and never will you find for them a helper except for those who repent correct themselves hold fast to allāh and are sincere in their religion for allāh for those will be with the believers and allāh is going to give the believers a great reward what would allāh do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe? and ever is allāh appreciative and knowing allāh does not like the public mention of evil except by one who has been wronged and ever is allāh hearing and knowing if you show good or conceal it or pardon an offense indeed allāh is ever pardoning and competent indeed those who disbelieve in allāh and his messengers and wish to discriminate between allāh and his messengers and say ""we believe in some and disbelieve in others"" and wish to adopt a way in between those are the disbelievers truly and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment but they who believe in allāh and his messengers and do not discriminate between any of them to those he is going to give their rewards and ever is allāh forgiving and merciful the people of the scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven but they had asked of moses greater than that and said ""show us allāh outright"" so the thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing then they took the calf after clear evidences had come to them and we pardoned that and we gave moses a clear authority and we raised over them the mount for their covenant and we said to them ""enter the gate bowing humbly"" and we said to them ""do not transgress on the sabbath"" and we took from them a solemn covenant and for their breaking of the covenant and their disbelief in the signs of allāh and their killing of the prophets without right and their saying ""our hearts are wrapped"" rather allāh has sealed them because of their disbelief so they believe not except for a few and for their disbelief and their saying against mary a great slander and their saying ""indeed we have killed the messiah jesus the son of mary the messenger of allāh"" and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him but was made to resemble him to them and indeed those who differ over it are in doubt about it they have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption and they did not kill him for certain rather allāh raised him to himself and ever is allāh exalted in might and wise and there is none from the people of the scripture but that he will surely believe in him before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be against them a witness for wrongdoing on the part of the jews we made unlawful for them good foods which had been lawful to them and for their averting from the way of allāh many and their taking of usury while they had been forbidden from it and their consuming of the people's wealth unjustly and we have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment but those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and the establishers of prayer and the givers of zakāh and the believers in allāh and the last day those we will give a great reward indeed we have revealed to you as we revealed to noah and the prophets after him and we revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob the descendants jesus job jonah aaron and solomon and to david we gave the book and messengers about whom we have related to you before and messengers about whom we have not related to you and allāh spoke to moses with speech messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against allāh after the messengers and ever is allāh exalted in might and wise but allāh bears witness to that which he has revealed to you he has sent it down with his knowledge and the angels bear witness and sufficient is allāh as witness indeed those who disbelieve and avert from the way of allāh have certainly gone far astray indeed those who disbelieve and commit wrong  never will allāh forgive them nor will he guide them to a path except the path of hell they will abide therein forever and that for allāh is easy o mankind the messenger has come to you with the truth from your lord so believe it is better for you but if you disbelieve then indeed to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth and ever is allāh knowing and wise o people of the scripture do not commit excess in your religion or say about allāh except the truth the messiah jesus the son of mary was but a messenger of allāh and his word which he directed to mary and a soul from him so believe in allāh and his messengers and do not say ""three"" desist it is better for you indeed allāh is but one god exalted is he above having a son to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and sufficient is allāh as disposer of affairs never would the messiah disdain to be a servant of allāh nor would the angels near and whoever disdains his worship and is arrogant he will gather them to himself all together and as for those who believed and did righteous deeds he will give them in full their rewards and grant them extra from his bounty but as for those who disdained and were arrogant he will punish them with a painful punishment and they will not find for themselves besides allāh any protector or helper o mankind there has come to you a conclusive proof from your lord and we have sent down to you a clear light so those who believe in allāh and hold fast to him he will admit them to mercy from himself and bounty and guide them to himself on a straight path they request from you a ruling say ""allāh gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants "" if a man dies leaving no child but a sister she will have half of what he left and he inherits from her if she has no child but if there are two sisters they will have two thirds of what he left if there are both brothers and sisters the male will have the share of two females allāh makes clear to you lest you go astray and allāh is knowing of all things"
5,44.049586776859506,5330,121,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful o you who have believed fulfill contracts lawful for you are the animals of grazing livestock except for that which is recited to you  hunting not being permitted while you are in the state of iḥrām indeed allāh ordains what he intends o you who have believed do not violate the rites of allāh or the sacred month or the sacrificial animals and garlanding or those coming to the sacred house seeking bounty from their lord and approval but when you come out of iḥrām then hunt and do not let the hatred of a people for having obstructed you from almasjid alḥarām lead you to transgress and cooperate in righteousness and piety but do not cooperate in sin and aggression and fear allāh indeed allāh is severe in penalty prohibited to you are dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allāh and killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a headlong fall or by the goring of horns and those from which a wild animal has eaten except what you slaughter and those which are sacrificed on stone altars and that you seek decision through divining arrows that is grave disobedience this day those who disbelieve have despaired of your religion so fear them not but fear me this day i have perfected for you your religion and completed my favor upon you and have approved for you islām as religion but whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin then indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful they ask you what has been made lawful for them say ""lawful for you are good foods and what you have trained of hunting animals which you train as allāh has taught you so eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of allāh upon it and fear allāh"" indeed allāh is swift in account this day good foods have been made lawful and the food of those who were given the scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them and chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the scripture before you when you have given them their due compensation desiring chastity not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking lovers and whoever denies the faith his work has become worthless and he in the hereafter will be among the losers o you who have believed when you rise to prayer wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles and if you are in a state of janābah then purify yourselves but if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it allāh does not intend to make difficulty for you but he intends to purify you and complete his favor upon you that you may be grateful and remember the favor of allāh upon you and his covenant with which he bound you when you said ""we hear and we obey"" and fear allāh indeed allāh is knowing of that within the breasts o you who have believed be persistently standing firm for allāh witnesses in justice and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just be just that is nearer to righteousness and fear allāh indeed allāh is aware of what you do allāh has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds for them there is forgiveness and great reward but those who disbelieve and deny our signs those are the companions of hellfire o you who have believed remember the favor of allāh upon you when a people determined to extend their hands against you but he withheld their hands from you and fear allāh and upon allāh let the believers rely and allāh had already taken a covenant from the children of israel and we delegated from among them twelve leaders and allāh said ""i am with you if you establish prayer and give zakāh and believe in my messengers and support them and loan allāh a goodly loan i will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow but whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way"" so for their breaking of the covenant we cursed them and made their hearts hardened they distort words from their places and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded and you will still observe deceit among them except a few of them but pardon them and overlook indeed allāh loves the doers of good and from those who say ""we are christians"" we took their covenant but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded so we caused among them animosity and hatred until the day of resurrection and allāh is going to inform them about what they used to do o people of the scripture there has come to you our messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the scripture and overlooking much there has come to you from allāh a light and a clear book by which allāh guides those who pursue his pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out from darknesses into the light by his permission and guides them to a straight path they have certainly disbelieved who say that allāh is christ the son of mary say ""then who could prevent allāh at all if he had intended to destroy christ the son of mary or his mother or everyone on the earth?"" and to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them he creates what he wills and allāh is over all things competent but the jews and the christians say ""we are the children of allāh and his beloved"" say ""then why does he punish you for your sins?"" rather you are human beings from among those he has created he forgives whom he wills and he punishes whom he wills and to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and to him is the destination o people of the scripture there has come to you our messenger to make clear to you after a period of messengers lest you say ""there came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner"" but there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner and allāh is over all things competent and when moses said to his people ""o my people remember the favor of allāh upon you when he appointed among you prophets and made you possessors and gave you that which he had not given anyone among the worlds o my people enter the blessed land which allāh has assigned to you and do not turn back and become losers"" they said ""o moses indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength and indeed we will never enter it until they leave it but if they leave it then we will enter"" said two men from those who feared upon whom allāh had bestowed favor ""enter upon them through the gate for when you have entered it you will be predominant and upon allāh rely if you should be believers"" they said ""o moses indeed we will not enter it ever as long as they are within it so go you and your lord and fight indeed we are remaining right here"" said ""my lord indeed i do not possess except myself and my brother so part us from the defiantly disobedient people"" said ""then indeed it is forbidden to them for forty years they will wander throughout the land so do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people"" and recite to them the story of adam's two sons in truth when they both made an offering and it was accepted from one of them but was not accepted from the other said ""i will surely kill you"" said ""indeed allāh only accepts from the righteous if you should raise your hand toward me to kill me i shall not raise my hand toward you to kill you indeed i fear allāh lord of the worlds indeed i want you to obtain my sin and your sin so you will be among the companions of the fire and that is the recompense of wrongdoers"" and his soul permitted to him the murder of his brother so he killed him and became among the losers then allāh sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother he said ""o woe to me! have i failed to be like this crow and hide the disgrace of my brother?"" and he became of the regretful because of that we decreed upon the children of israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption in the land it is as if he had slain mankind entirely and whoever saves one it is as if he had saved mankind entirely and our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs then indeed many of them after that throughout the land were transgressors indeed the penalty for those who wage war against allāh and his messenger and strive upon earth corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land that is for them a disgrace in this world and for them in the hereafter is a great punishment except for those who return before you overcome them and know that allāh is forgiving and merciful o you who have believed fear allāh and seek the means to him and strive in his cause that you may succeed indeed those who disbelieve if they should have all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the punishment of the day of resurrection it will not be accepted from them and for them is a painful punishment they will wish to get out of the fire but never are they to emerge therefrom and for them is an enduring punishment the thief the male and the female amputate their hands in recompense for what they earned as a deterrent from allāh and allāh is exalted in might and wise but whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms indeed allāh will turn to him in forgiveness indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful do you not know that to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? he punishes whom he wills and forgives whom he wills and allāh is over all things competent o messenger let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief of those who say ""we believe"" with their mouths but their hearts believe not and from among the jews avid listeners to falsehood listening to another people who have not come to you they distort words beyond their places saying ""if you are given this take it but if you are not given it then beware"" but he for whom allāh intends fitnah never will you possess for him a thing against allāh those are the ones for whom allāh does not intend to purify their hearts for them in this world is disgrace and for them in the hereafter is a great punishment avid listeners to falsehood devourers of unlawful so if they come to you judge between them or turn away from them and if you turn away from them never will they harm you at all and if you judge judge between them with justice indeed allāh loves those who act justly but how is it that they come to you for judgement while they have the torah in which is the judgement of allāh? then they turn away after that but those are not believers indeed we sent down the torah in which was guidance and light the prophets who submitted judged by it for the jews as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the scripture of allāh and they were witnesses thereto so do not fear the people but fear me and do not exchange my verses for a small price and whoever does not judge by what allāh has revealed then it is those who are the disbelievers and we ordained for them therein a life for a life an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and for wounds is legal retribution but whoever gives charity it is an expiation for him and whoever does not judge by what allāh has revealed then it is those who are the wrongdoers and we sent following in their footsteps jesus the son of mary confirming that which came before him in the torah and we gave him the gospel in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous and let the people of the gospel judge by what allāh has revealed therein and whoever does not judge by what allāh has revealed then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient and we have revealed to you the book in truth confirming that which preceded it of the scripture and as a criterion over it so judge between them by what allāh has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth to each of you we prescribed a law and a method had allāh willed he would have made you one nation but to test you in what he has given you so race to good to allāh is your return all together and he will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ and judge between them by what allāh has revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them lest they tempt you away from some of what allāh has revealed to you and if they turn away then know that allāh only intends to afflict them with some of their sins and indeed many among the people are defiantly disobedient then is it the judgement of ignorance they desire? but who is better than allāh in judgement for a people who are certain o you who have believed do not take the jews and the christians as allies they are allies of one another and whoever is an ally to them among you then indeed he is of them indeed allāh guides not the wrongdoing people so you see those in whose hearts is disease hastening into them saying ""we are afraid a misfortune may strike us"" but perhaps allāh will bring conquest or a decision from him and they will become over what they have been concealing within themselves regretful and those who believe will say ""are these the ones who swore by allāh their strongest oaths that indeed they were with you?"" their deeds have become worthless and they have become losers o you who have believed whoever of you should revert from his religion allāh will bring forth a people he will love and who will love him humble toward the believers strong against the disbelievers they strive in the cause of allāh and do not fear the blame of a critic that is the favor of allāh he bestows it upon whom he wills and allāh is allencompassing and knowing your ally is none but allāh and his messenger and those who have believed those who establish prayer and give zakāh and they bow and whoever is an ally of allāh and his messenger and those who have believed indeed the party of allāh they will be the predominant o you who have believed take not those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies and fear allāh if you should be believers and when you call to prayer they take it in ridicule and amusement that is because they are a people who do not use reason say ""o people of the scripture do you resent us except that we have believed in allāh and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before and because most of you are defiantly disobedient?"" say ""shall i inform you of worse than that as penalty from allāh? those whom allāh has cursed and with whom he became angry and made of them apes and pigs and slaves of ṭāghūt those are worse in position and further astray from the sound way"" and when they come to you they say ""we believe"" but they have entered with disbelief and they have certainly left with it and allāh is most knowing of what they were concealing and you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and the devouring of unlawful how wretched is what they have been doing why do the rabbis and religious scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful? how wretched is what they have been practicing and the jews say ""the hand of allāh is chained"" chained are their hands and cursed are they for what they say rather both his hands are extended he spends however he wills and that which has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief and we have cast among them animosity and hatred until the day of resurrection every time they kindled the fire of war allāh extinguished it and they strive throughout the land corruption and allāh does not like corrupters and if only the people of the scripture had believed and feared allāh we would have removed from them their misdeeds and admitted them to gardens of pleasure and if only they had upheld the torah the gospel and what has been revealed to them from their lord they would have consumed from above them and from beneath their feet among them are a moderate community but many of them evil is that which they do o messenger announce that which has been revealed to you from your lord and if you do not then you have not conveyed his message and allāh will protect you from the people indeed allāh does not guide the disbelieving people say ""o people of the scripture you are on nothing until you uphold the torah the gospel and what has been revealed to you from your lord "" and that which has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief so do not grieve over the disbelieving people indeed those who have believed and those who were jews or sabeans or christians those who believed in allāh and the last day and did righteousness no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve we had already taken the covenant of the children of israel and had sent to them messengers whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire a party they denied and another party they killed and they thought there would be no punishment so they became blind and deaf then allāh turned to them in forgiveness then many of them became blind and deaf and allāh is seeing of what they do they have certainly disbelieved who say ""allāh is the messiah the son of mary"" while the messiah has said ""o children of israel worship allāh my lord and your lord"" indeed he who associates others with allāh allāh has forbidden him paradise and his refuge is the fire and there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers they have certainly disbelieved who say ""allāh is the third of three"" and there is no god except one god and if they do not desist from what they are saying there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment so will they not repent to allāh and seek his forgiveness? and allāh is forgiving and merciful the messiah son of mary was not but a messenger messengers have passed on before him and his mother was a supporter of truth they both used to eat food look how we make clear to them the signs then look how they are deluded say ""do you worship besides allāh that which holds for you no harm or benefit while it is allāh who is the hearing the knowing?"" say ""o people of the scripture do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way"" cursed were those who disbelieved among the children of israel by the tongue of david and of jesus the son of mary that was because they disobeyed and transgressed they used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did how wretched was that which they were doing you see many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved how wretched is that which they have put forth for themselves in that allāh has become angry with them and in the punishment they will abide eternally and if they had believed in allāh and the prophet and in what was revealed to him they would not have taken them as allies but many of them are defiantly disobedient you will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers the jews and those who associate others with allāh and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say ""we are christians"" that is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth they say ""our lord we have believed so register us among the witnesses and why should we not believe in allāh and what has come to us of the truth? and we aspire that our lord will admit us with the righteous people"" so allāh rewarded them for what they said with gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and that is the reward of doers of good but those who disbelieved and denied our signs they are the companions of hellfire o you who have believed do not prohibit the good things which allāh has made lawful to you and do not transgress indeed allāh does not like transgressors and eat of what allāh has provided for you lawful and good and fear allāh in whom you are believers allāh will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths but he will impose blame upon you for what you intended of oaths so its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave but whoever cannot find  then a fast of three days that is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn but guard your oaths thus does allāh make clear to you his verses that you may be grateful o you who have believed indeed intoxicants gambling stone alters and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of satan so avoid it that you may be successful satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of allāh and from prayer so will you not desist? and obey allāh and obey the messenger and beware and if you turn away then know that upon our messenger is only clear notification there is not upon those who believe and do righteousness blame concerning what they have eaten if they fear allāh and believe and do righteous deeds and then fear allāh and believe and then fear allāh and do good and allāh loves the doers of good o you who have believed allāh will surely test you through something of the game that your hands and spears reach that allāh may make evident those who fear him unseen and whoever transgresses after that for him is a painful punishment o you who have believed do not kill game while you are in the state of iḥrām and whoever of you kills it intentionally the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what he killed as judged by two just men among you as an offering delivered to the kaʿbah or an expiation the feeding of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting that he may taste the consequence of his matter allāh has pardoned what is past but whoever returns then allāh will take retribution from him and allāh is exalted in might and owner of retribution lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you and the travelers but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of iḥrām and fear allāh to whom you will be gathered allāh has made the kaʿbah the sacred house standing for the people and the sacred months and the sacrificial animals and the garlands that is so you may know that allāh knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that allāh is knowing of all things know that allāh is severe in penalty and that allāh is forgiving and merciful not upon the messenger is except notification and allāh knows whatever you reveal and whatever you conceal say ""not equal are the evil and the good although the abundance of evil might impress you"" so fear allāh o you of understanding that you may be successful o you who have believed do not ask about things which if they are shown to you will distress you but if you ask about them while the qur’ān is being revealed they will be shown to you allāh has pardoned it and allāh is forgiving and forbearing a people asked such before you then they became thereby disbelievers allāh has not appointed baḥīrah or sā’ibah or waṣīlah or ḥām but those who disbelieve invent falsehood about allāh and most of them do not reason and when it is said to them ""come to what allāh has revealed and to the messenger"" they say ""sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers"" even though their fathers knew nothing nor were they guided? o you who have believed upon you is yourselves those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided to allāh is your return all together then he will inform you of what you used to do o you who have believed testimony among you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest  two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by allāh if you doubt ""we will not exchange it for a price even if he should be a near relative and we will not withhold the testimony of allāh indeed we would then be of the sinful"" but if it is found that those two were guilty of sin let two others stand in their place foremost from those who have a lawful right and let them swear by allāh ""our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed indeed we would then be of the wrongdoers"" that is more likely that they will give testimony according to its objective or they would fear that oaths might be taken after their oaths and fear allāh and listen and allāh does not guide the defiantly disobedient people the day when allāh will assemble the messengers and say ""what was the response you received?"" they will say ""we have no knowledge indeed it is you who is knower of the unseen"" when allāh will say ""o jesus son of mary remember my favor upon you and upon your mother when i supported you with the pure spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity and when i taught you writing and wisdom and the torah and the gospel and when you designed from clay like the form of a bird with my permission then you breathed into it and it became a bird with my permission and you healed the blind and the leper with my permission and when you brought forth the dead with my permission and when i restrained the children of israel from you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said ""this is not but obvious magic"" and when i inspired to the disciples ""believe in me and in my messenger "" they said ""we have believed so bear witness that indeed we are muslims "" when the disciples said ""o jesus son of mary can your lord send down to us a table from the heaven?"" said ""fear allāh if you should be believers"" they said ""we wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses"" said jesus the son of mary ""o allāh our lord send down to us a table from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from you and provide for us and you are the best of providers"" allāh said ""indeed i will send it down to you but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you then indeed will i punish him with a punishment by which i have not punished anyone among the worlds"" and when allāh will say ""o jesus son of mary did you say to the people 'take me and my mother as deities besides allāh?'"" he will say ""exalted are you! it was not for me to say that to which i have no right if i had said it you would have known it you know what is within myself and i do not know what is within yourself indeed it is you who is knower of the unseen i said not to them except what you commanded me to worship allāh my lord and your lord and i was a witness over them as long as i was among them but when you took me up you were the observer over them and you are over all things witness if you should punish them indeed they are your servants but if you forgive them indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise"" allāh will say ""this is the day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness"" for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever allāh being pleased with them and they with him that is the great attainment to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them and he is over all things competent"
6,35.7710843373494,5938,166,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful praise is to allāh who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light then those who disbelieve equate with their lord it is he who created you from clay and then decreed a term and a specified time to him then you are in dispute and he is allāh in the heavens and the earth he knows your secret and what you make public and he knows that which you earn and no sign comes to them from the signs of their lord except that they turn away therefrom for they had denied the truth when it came to them but there is going to reach them the news of what they used to ridicule have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them which we had established upon the earth as we have not established you? and we sent the sky upon them in showers and made rivers flow beneath them then we destroyed them for their sins and brought forth after them a generation of others and even if we had sent down to you a written scripture on a page and they touched it with their hands the disbelievers would say ""this is not but obvious magic"" and they say ""why was there not sent down to him an angel?"" but if we had sent down an angel the matter would have been decided then they would not be reprieved and if we had made him an angel we would have made him a man and we would have covered them with that in which they cover themselves and already were messengers ridiculed before you but those who mocked them were enveloped by that which they used to ridicule say ""travel through the land then observe how was the end of the deniers"" say ""to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth?"" say ""to allāh"" he has decreed upon himself mercy he will surely assemble you for the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt those who will lose themselves do not believe and to him belongs that which reposes by night and by day and he is the hearing the knowing say ""is it other than allāh i should take as a protector creator of the heavens and earth while it is he who feeds and is not fed?"" say ""indeed i have been commanded to be the first who submit and 'do not ever be of the polytheists"" say ""indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day"" he from whom it is averted that day  has granted him mercy and that is the clear attainment and if allāh should touch you with adversity there is no remover of it except him and if he touches you with good then he is over all things competent and he is the subjugator over his servants and he is the wise the aware say ""what thing is greatest in testimony?"" say ""allāh is witness between me and you and this qur’ān was revealed to me that i may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches do you testify that with allāh there are other deities?"" say ""i will not testify "" say ""indeed he is but one god and indeed i am free of what you associate "" those to whom we have given the scripture recognize it as they recognize their sons those who will lose themselves do not believe and who is more unjust than one who invents about allāh a lie or denies his verses? indeed the wrongdoers will not succeed and the day we will gather them all together then we will say to those who associated others with allāh ""where are your 'partners' that you used to claim ?"" then there will be no examination except they will say ""by allāh our lord we were not those who associated"" see how they will lie about themselves and lost from them will be what they used to invent and among them are those who listen to you but we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and if they should see every sign they will not believe in it even when they come to you arguing with you those who disbelieve say ""this is not but legends of the former peoples"" and they prevent from him and are remote from him and they do not destroy except themselves but they perceive not if you could but see when they are made to stand before the fire and will say ""oh would that we could be returned and not deny the signs of our lord and be among the believers"" but what they concealed before has appeared to them and even if they were returned they would return to that which they were forbidden and indeed they are liars and they say ""there is none but our worldly life and we will not be resurrected"" if you could but see when they will be made to stand before their lord he will say ""is this not the truth?"" they will say ""yes by our lord"" he will say ""so taste the punishment for what you used to deny"" those will have lost who deny the meeting with allāh until when the hour comes upon them unexpectedly they will say ""oh our regret over what we neglected concerning it "" while they bear their burdens on their backs unquestionably evil is that which they bear and the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion but the home of the hereafter is best for those who fear allāh so will you not reason? we know that you are saddened by what they say and indeed they do not call you untruthful but it is the verses of allāh that the wrongdoers reject and certainly were messengers denied before you but they were patient over the denial and they were harmed until our victory came to them and none can alter the words of allāh and there has certainly come to you some information about the messengers and if their evasion is difficult for you then if you are able to seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign but if allāh had willed he would have united them upon guidance so never be of the ignorant only those who hear will respond but the dead allāh will resurrect them then to him they will be returned and they say ""why has a sign not been sent down to him from his lord?"" say ""indeed allāh is able to send down a sign but most of them do not know"" and there is no creature on the earth or bird that flies with its wings except communities like you we have not neglected in the register a thing then unto their lord they will be gathered but those who deny our verses are deaf and dumb within darknesses whomever allāh wills he sends astray and whomever he wills he puts him on a straight path say ""have you considered if there came to you the punishment of allāh or there came to you the hour is it other than allāh you would invoke if you should be truthful?"" no it is him you would invoke and he would remove that for which you invoked him if he willed and you would forget what you associate and we have already sent to nations before you then we seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves then why when our punishment came to them did they not humble themselves? but their hearts became hardened and satan made attractive to them that which they were doing so when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we opened to them the doors of every thing until when they rejoiced in that which they were given we seized them suddenly and they were in despair so the people that committed wrong were eliminated and praise to allāh lord of the worlds say ""have you considered if allāh should take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts which deity other than allāh could bring them to you?"" look how we diversify the verses then they turn away say ""have you considered if the punishment of allāh should come to you unexpectedly or manifestly will any be destroyed but the wrongdoing people?"" and we send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners so whoever believes and reforms there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve but those who deny our verses the punishment will touch them for their defiant disobedience say ""i do not tell you that i have the depositories of allāh or that i know the unseen nor do i tell you that i am an angel i only follow what is revealed to me"" say ""is the blind equivalent to the seeing? then will you not give thought?"" and warn by it those who fear that they will be gathered before their lord for them besides him will be no protector and no intercessor that they might become righteous and do not send away those who call upon their lord morning and afternoon seeking his face not upon you is anything of their account and not upon them is anything of your account so were you to send them away you would be of the wrongdoers and thus we have tried some of them through others that they might say ""is it these whom allāh has favored among us?"" is not allāh most knowing of those who are grateful? and when those come to you who believe in our verses say ""peace be upon you your lord has decreed upon himself mercy that any of you who does wrong out of ignorance and then repents after that and corrects himself indeed he is forgiving and merciful"" and thus do we detail the verses and the way of the criminals will become evident say ""indeed i have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides allāh"" say ""i will not follow your desires for i would then have gone astray and i would not be of the guided"" say ""indeed i am on clear evidence from my lord and you have denied it i do not have that for which you are impatient the decision is only for allāh he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders"" say ""if i had that for which you are impatient the matter would have been decided between me and you but allāh is most knowing of the wrongdoers"" and with him are the keys of the unseen none knows them except him and he knows what is on the land and in the sea not a leaf falls but that he knows it and no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry but that it is in a clear record and it is he who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day then he revives you therein that a specified term may be fulfilled then to him will be your return then he will inform you about what you used to do and he is the subjugator over his servants and he sends over you guardianangels until when death comes to one of you our messengers take him and they do not fail then they are returned to allāh their true lord unquestionably his is the judgement and he is the swiftest of accountants say ""who rescues you from the darknesses of the land and sea you call upon him imploring and privately 'if he should save us from this we will surely be among the thankful'"" say ""it is allāh who saves you from it and from every distress then you associate others with him"" say ""he is the able to send upon you affliction from above you or from beneath your feet or to confuse you sects and make you taste the violence of one another"" look how we diversify the signs that they might understand but your people have denied it while it is the truth say ""i am not over you a manager "" for every news is a finality and you are going to know and when you see those who engage in discourse concerning our verses then turn away from them until they enter into another conversation and if satan should cause you to forget then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people and those who fear allāh are not held accountable for them at all but a reminder that perhaps they will fear him and leave those who take their religion as amusement and diversion and whom the worldly life has deluded but remind with it lest a soul be given up to destruction for what it earned it will have other than allāh no protector and no intercessor and if it should offer every compensation it would not be taken from it those are the ones who are given to destruction for what they have earned for them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve say ""shall we invoke instead of allāh that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after allāh has guided us? like one whom the devils enticed upon the earth confused he has companions inviting him to guidance 'come to us'"" say ""indeed the guidance of allāh is the guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds and to establish prayer and fear him"" and it is he to whom you will be gathered and it is he who created the heavens and earth in truth and the day he says ""be"" and it is his word is the truth and his is the dominion the day the horn is blown knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he is the wise the aware and when abraham said to his father āzar ""do you take idols as deities? indeed i see you and your people to be in manifest error"" and thus did we show abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain so when the night covered him he saw a star he said ""this is my lord"" but when it set he said ""i like not those that set "" and when he saw the moon rising he said ""this is my lord"" but when it set he said ""unless my lord guides me i will surely be among the people gone astray"" and when he saw the sun rising he said ""this is my lord this is greater"" but when it set he said ""o my people indeed i am free from what you associate with allāh indeed i have turned my face toward he who created the heavens and the earth inclining toward truth and i am not of those who associate others with allāh"" and his people argued with him he said ""do you argue with me concerning allāh while he has guided me? and i fear not what you associate with him unless my lord should will something my lord encompasses all things in knowledge then will you not remember? and how should i fear what you associate while you do not fear that you have associated with allāh that for which he has not sent down to you any authority? so which of the two parties has more right to security if you should know?"" they who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice those will have security and they are guided and that was our argument which we gave abraham against his people we raise by degrees whom we will indeed your lord is wise and knowing and we gave to him isaac and jacob all we guided and noah we guided before and among his descendants david and solomon and job and joseph and moses and aaron thus do we reward the doers of good and zechariah and john and jesus and elias and all were of the righteous and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot and all we preferred over the worlds and among their fathers and their descendants and their brothers and we chose them and we guided them to a straight path that is the guidance of allāh by which he guides whomever he wills of his servants but if they had associated others with allāh then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing those are the ones to whom we gave the scripture and authority and prophethood but if they deny it then we have entrusted it to a people who are not therein disbelievers those are the ones whom allāh has guided so from their guidance take an example say ""i ask of you for it no payment it is not but a reminder for the worlds"" and they did not appraise allāh with true appraisal when they said ""allāh did not reveal to a human being anything"" say ""who revealed the scripture that moses brought as light and guidance to the people? you make it into pages disclosing it and concealing much and you were taught that which you knew not neither you nor your fathers"" say ""allāh "" then leave them in their discourse amusing themselves and this is a book which we have sent down blessed and confirming what was before it that you may warn the mother of cities and those around it those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are maintaining their prayers and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allāh or says ""it has been inspired to me"" while nothing has been inspired to him and one who says ""i will reveal like what allāh revealed"" and if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands ""discharge your souls! today you will be awarded the punishment of humiliation for what you used to say against allāh other than the truth and you were toward his verses being arrogant"" ""and you have certainly come to us alone as we created you the first time and you have left whatever we bestowed upon you behind you and we do not see with you your 'intercessors' which you claimed that they were among you associates it has been severed between you and lost from you is what you used to claim"" indeed allāh is the cleaver of grain and date seeds he brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living that is allāh so how are you deluded? the cleaver of daybreak and has made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing and it is he who placed for you the stars that you may be guided by them through the darknesses of the land and sea we have detailed the signs for a people who know and it is he who produced you from one soul and a place of dwelling and of storage we have detailed the signs for a people who understand and it is he who sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby the growth of all things we produce from it greenery from which we produce grains arranged in layers and from the palm trees of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low and gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates similar yet varied look at its fruit when it yields and its ripening indeed in that are signs for a people who believe but they have attributed to allāh partners the jinn while he has created them and have fabricated for him sons and daughters without knowledge exalted is he and high above what they describe originator of the heavens and the earth how could he have a son when he does not have a companion and he created all things? and he is of all things knowing that is allāh your lord there is no deity except him the creator of all things so worship him and he is disposer of all things vision perceives him not but he perceives vision and he is the subtle the aware there has come to you enlightenment from your lord so whoever will see does so for his soul and whoever is blind against it and ""i am not a guardian over you"" and thus do we diversify the verses so they will say ""you have studied"" and so we may make it clear for a people who know follow what has been revealed to you from your lord there is no deity except him and turn away from those who associate others with allāh but if allāh had willed they would not have associated and we have not appointed you over them as a guardian nor are you a manager over them and do not insult those they invoke other than allāh lest they insult allāh in enmity without knowledge thus we have made pleasing to every community their deeds then to their lord is their return and he will inform them about what they used to do and they swear by allāh their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them they would surely believe in it say ""the signs are only with allāh"" and what will make you perceive that even if it came they would not believe and we will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they refused to believe in it the first time and we will leave them in their transgression wandering blindly and even if we had sent down to them the angels and the dead spoke to them and we gathered together every thing in front of them they would not believe unless allāh should will but most of them are ignorant and thus we have made for every prophet an enemy devils from mankind and jinn inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion but if your lord had willed they would not have done it so leave them and that which they invent and so the hearts of those who disbelieve in the hereafter will incline toward it and that they will be satisfied with it and that they will commit that which they are committing ""then is it other than allāh i should seek as judge while it is he who has revealed to you the book explained in detail?"" and those to whom we gave the scripture know that it is sent down from your lord in truth so never be among the doubters and the word of your lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice none can alter his words and he is the hearing the knowing and if you obey most of those upon the earth they will mislead you from the way of allāh they follow not except assumption and they are not but misjudging indeed your lord is most knowing of who strays from his way and he is most knowing of the guided so eat of that upon which the name of allāh has been mentioned if you are believers in his verses and why should you not eat of that upon which the name of allāh has been mentioned while he has explained in detail to you what he has forbidden you excepting that to which you are compelled and indeed do many lead astray through their inclinations without knowledge indeed your lord he is most knowing of the transgressors and leave what is apparent of sin and what is concealed thereof indeed those who earn sin will be recompensed for that which they used to commit and do not eat of that upon which the name of allāh has not been mentioned for indeed it is grave disobedience and indeed do the devils inspire their allies to dispute with you and if you were to obey them indeed you would be associators and is one who was dead and we gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness never to emerge therefrom? thus it has been made pleasing to the disbelievers that which they were doing and thus we have placed within every city the greatest of its criminals to conspire therein but they conspire not except against themselves and they perceive not and when a sign comes to them they say ""never will we believe until we are given like that which was given to the messengers of allāh"" allāh is most knowing of where he places his message there will afflict those who committed crimes debasement before allāh and severe punishment for what they used to conspire so whoever allāh wants to guide he expands his breast to islām and whoever he wants to send astray he makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky thus does allāh place defilement upon those who do not believe and this is the path of your lord straight we have detailed the verses for a people who remember for them will be the home of peace with their lord and he will be their protecting friend because of what they used to do and the day when he will gather them together ""o company of jinn you have many of mankind"" and their allies among mankind will say ""our lord some of us made use of others and we have reached our term which you appointed for us"" he will say ""the fire is your residence wherein you will abide eternally except for what allāh wills indeed your lord is wise and knowing"" and thus will we make some of the wrongdoers allies of others for what they used to earn ""o company of jinn and mankind did there not come to you messengers from among you relating to you my verses and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours?"" they will say ""we bear witness against ourselves"" and the worldly life had deluded them and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers that is because your lord would not destroy the cities for wrongdoing while their people were unaware and for all are degrees from what they have done and your lord is not unaware of what they do and your lord is the free of need the possessor of mercy if he wills he can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever he wills just as he produced you from the descendants of another people indeed what you are promised is coming and you will not cause failure say ""o my people work according to your position indeed i am working and you are going to know who will have succession in the home indeed the wrongdoers will not succeed"" and they assign to allāh from that which he created of crops and livestock a share and say ""this is for allāh"" by their claim ""and this is for our 'partners' "" but what is for their ""partners"" does not reach allāh while what is for allāh this reaches their ""partners"" evil is that which they rule and likewise to many of the polytheists their partners have made pleasing the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to cover them with confusion in their religion and if allāh had willed they would not have done so so leave them and that which they invent and they say ""these animals and crops are forbidden no one may eat from them except whom we will"" by their claim and there are those whose backs are forbidden and those upon which the name of allāh is not mentioned  an invention of untruth about him he will punish them for what they were inventing and they say ""what is in the bellies of these animals is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females but if it is dead then all of them have shares therein"" he will punish them for their description indeed he is wise and knowing they will have lost who killed their children in foolishness without knowledge and prohibited what allāh had provided for them inventing untruth about allāh they have gone astray and were not guided and he it is who causes gardens to grow trellised and untrellised and palm trees and crops of different food and olives and pomegranates similar and dissimilar eat of its fruit when it yields and give its due on the day of its harvest and be not excessive indeed he does not like those who commit excess and of the grazing livestock are carriers and those small eat of what allāh has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy eight mates of the sheep two and of the goats two say ""is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? inform me with knowledge if you should be truthful"" and of the camels two and of the cattle two say ""is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? or were you witnesses when allāh charged you with this? then who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allāh to mislead the people by other than knowledge? indeed allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people"" say ""i do not find within that which was revealed to me forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine for indeed it is impure or it be disobedience dedicated to other than allāh but whoever is forced neither desiring nor transgressing then indeed your lord is forgiving and merciful"" and to those who are jews we prohibited every animal of uncloven hoof and of the cattle and the sheep we prohibited to them their fat except what adheres to their backs or the entrails or what is joined with bone that we repaid them for their transgression and indeed we are truthful so if they deny you say ""your lord is the possessor of vast mercy but his punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals"" those who associated with allāh will say ""if allāh had willed we would not have associated and neither would our fathers nor would we have prohibited anything"" likewise did those before deny until they tasted our punishment say ""do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? you follow not except assumption and you are not but misjudging"" say ""with allāh is the farreaching argument if he had willed he would have guided you all"" say ""bring forward your witnesses who will testify that allāh has prohibited this"" and if they testify do not testify with them and do not follow the desires of those who deny our verses and those who do not believe in the hereafter while they equate with their lord say ""come i will recite what your lord has prohibited to you that you not associate anything with him and to parents good treatment and do not kill your children out of poverty we will provide for you and them and do not approach immoralities what is apparent of them and what is concealed and do not kill the soul which allāh has forbidden except by right this has he instructed you that you may use reason"" and do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best until he reaches maturity and give full measure and weight in justice we do not charge any soul except its capacity and when you speak be just even if a near relative and the covenant of allāh fulfill this has he instructed you that you may remember and this is my path which is straight so follow it and do not follow ways for you will be separated from his way this has he instructed you that you may become righteous then we gave moses the scripture making complete upon the one who did good and as a detailed explanation of all things and as guidance and mercy that perhaps in the meeting with their lord they would believe and this is a book we have revealed blessed so follow it and fear allāh that you may receive mercy lest you say ""the scripture was only sent down to two groups before us but we were of their study unaware"" or lest you say ""if only the scripture had been revealed to us we would have been better guided than they"" so there has come to you a clear evidence from your lord and a guidance and mercy then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of allāh and turns away from them? we will recompense those who turn away from our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away do they wait for anything except that the angels should come to them or your lord should come or that there come some of the signs of your lord? the day that some of the signs of your lord will come no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good say ""wait indeed we are waiting"" indeed those who have divided their religion and become sects you are not with them in anything their affair is only to allāh then he will inform them about what they used to do whoever comes with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof and they will not be wronged say ""indeed my lord has guided me to a straight path a correct religion the way of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not among those who associated others with allāh"" say ""indeed my prayer my rites of sacrifice my living and my dying are for allāh lord of the worlds no partner has he and this i have been commanded and i am the first of the muslims"" say ""is it other than allāh i should desire as a lord while he is the lord of all things? and every soul earns not except against itself and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return and he will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ"" and it is he who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees that he may try you through what he has given you indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful"
7,31.55072463768116,6531,207,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful alif lām meem ṣād a book revealed to you  so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom that you may warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers follow what has been revealed to you from your lord and do not follow other than him any allies little do you remember and how many cities have we destroyed and our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon and their declaration when our punishment came to them was only that they said ""indeed we were wrongdoers!"" then we will surely question those to whom was sent and we will surely question the messengers then we will surely relate to them with knowledge and we were not absent and the weighing that day will be the truth so those whose scales are heavy it is they who will be the successful and those whose scales are light they are the ones who will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verses and we have certainly established you upon the earth and made for you therein ways of livelihood little are you grateful and we have certainly created you and given you form then we said to the angels ""prostrate to adam"" so they prostrated except for iblees he was not of those who prostrated said ""what prevented you from prostrating when i commanded you?"" said ""i am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay "" said ""descend from it for it is not for you to be arrogant therein so get out indeed you are of the debased"" said ""reprieve me until the day they are resurrected"" said ""indeed you are of those reprieved"" said ""because you have put me in error i will surely sit in wait for them on your straight path then i will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left and you will not find most of them grateful "" said ""depart from it reproached and expelled whoever follows you among them i will surely fill hell with you all together"" and ""o adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers"" but satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts he said ""your lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal"" and he swore to them ""indeed i am to you from among the sincere advisors"" so he made them fall through deception and when they tasted of the tree their private parts became apparent to them and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of paradise and their lord called to them ""did i not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is to you a clear enemy?"" they said ""our lord we have wronged ourselves and if you do not forgive us and have mercy upon us we will surely be among the losers"" said ""descend being to one another enemies and for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoyment for a time"" he said ""therein you will live and therein you will die and from it you will be brought forth"" o children of adam we have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts and as adornment but the clothing of righteousness that is best that is from the signs of allāh that perhaps they will remember o children of adam let not satan tempt you as he removed your parents from paradise stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts indeed he sees you he and his tribe from where you do not see them indeed we have made the devils allies to those who do not believe and when they commit an immorality they say ""we found our fathers doing it and allāh has ordered us to do it"" say ""indeed allāh does not order immorality do you say about allāh that which you do not know?"" say ""my lord has ordered justice and that you direct yourselves at every place of prostration and invoke him sincere to him in religion"" just as he originated you you will return a group he guided and a group deserved error indeed they had taken the devils as allies instead of allāh while they thought that they were guided o children of adam take your adornment at every masjid and eat and drink but be not excessive indeed he likes not those who commit excess say ""who has forbidden the adornment of allāh which he has produced for his servants and the good things of provision?"" say ""they are for those who believed during the life of this world exclusively on the day of resurrection"" thus do we detail the verses for a people who know say ""my lord has only forbidden immoralities what is apparent of them and what is concealed and sin and oppression without right and that you associate with allāh that for which he has not sent down authority and that you say about allāh that which you do not know"" and for every nation is a term so when their time has come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede o children of adam if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you my verses then whoever fears allāh and reforms there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve but the ones who deny our verses and are arrogant toward them those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally and who is more unjust than one who invents about allāh a lie or denies his verses? those will attain their portion of the decree until when our messengers come to them to take them in death they will say ""where are those you used to invoke besides allāh?"" they will say ""they have departed from us"" and will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers will say ""enter among nations which had passed on before you of jinn and mankind into the fire"" every time a nation enters it will curse its sister until when they have all overtaken one another therein the last of them will say about the first of them ""our lord these had misled us so give them a double punishment of the fire"" he will say ""for each is double but you do not know"" and the first of them will say to the last of them ""then you had not any favor over us so taste the punishment for what you used to earn"" indeed those who deny our verses and are arrogant toward them the gates of heaven will not be opened for them nor will they enter paradise until a camel enters into the eye of a needle and thus do we recompense the criminals they will have from hell a bed and over them coverings and thus do we recompense the wrongdoers but those who believed and did righteous deeds we charge no soul except its capacity those are the companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally and we will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment flowing beneath them are rivers and they will say ""praise to allāh who has guided us to this and we would never have been guided if allāh had not guided us certainly the messengers of our lord had come with the truth"" and they will be called ""this is paradise which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do"" and the companions of paradise will call out to the companions of the fire ""we have already found what our lord promised us to be true have you found what your lord promised to be true?"" they will say ""yes"" then an announcer will announce among them ""the curse of allāh shall be upon the wrongdoers who averted from the way of allāh and sought to make it deviant while they were concerning the hereafter disbelievers"" and between them will be a partition and on elevations are men who recognize all by their mark and they call out to the companions of paradise ""peace be upon you"" they have not entered it but they long intensely and when their eyes are turned toward the companions of the fire they say ""our lord do not place us with the wrongdoing people"" and the companions of the elevations will call to men whom they recognize by their mark saying ""of no avail to you was your gathering and that you were arrogant"" ""are these the ones whom you swore that allāh would never offer them mercy? enter paradise no fear will there be concerning you nor will you grieve"" and the companions of the fire will call to the companions of paradise ""pour upon us some water or from whatever allāh has provided you"" they will say ""indeed allāh has forbidden them both to the disbelievers who took their religion as distraction and amusement and whom the worldly life deluded"" so today we will forget them just as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and for having rejected our verses and we had certainly brought them a book which we detailed by knowledge as guidance and mercy to a people who believe do they await except its result? the day its result comes those who had ignored it before will say ""the messengers of our lord had come with the truth so are there any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than what we used to do?"" they will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent indeed your lord is allāh who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established himself above the throne he covers the night with the day chasing it rapidly and the sun the moon and the stars subjected by his command unquestionably his is the creation and the command blessed is allāh lord of the worlds call upon your lord in humility and privately indeed he does not like transgressors and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation and invoke him in fear and aspiration indeed the mercy of allāh is near to the doers of good and it is he who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy until when they have carried heavy rainclouds we drive them to a dead land and we send down rain therein and bring forth thereby of all the fruits thus will we bring forth the dead perhaps you may be reminded and the good land its vegetation emerges by permission of its lord but that which is bad nothing emerges except sparsely with difficulty thus do we diversify the signs for a people who are grateful we had certainly sent noah to his people and he said ""o my people worship allāh you have no deity other than him indeed i fear for you the punishment of a tremendous day"" said the eminent among his people ""indeed we see you in clear error"" said ""o my people there is not error in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds i convey to you the messages of my lord and advise you and i know from allāh what you do not know then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you and that you may fear allāh so you might receive mercy?"" but they denied him so we saved him and those who were with him in the ship and we drowned those who denied our signs indeed they were a blind people and to the ʿaad their brother hūd he said ""o my people worship allāh you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him?"" said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people ""indeed we see you in foolishness and indeed we think you are of the liars"" said ""o my people there is not foolishness in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds i convey to you the messages of my lord and i am to you a trustworthy adviser then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you? and remember when he made you successors after the people of noah and increased you in stature extensively so remember the favors of allāh that you might succeed"" they said ""have you come to us that we should worship allāh alone and leave what our fathers have worshipped? then bring us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful"" said ""already have defilement and anger fallen upon you from your lord do you dispute with me concerning names you have named them you and your fathers for which allāh has not sent down any authority? then wait indeed i am with you among those who wait"" so we saved him and those with him by mercy from us and we eliminated those who denied our signs and they were not believers and to the thamūd their brother ṣāliḥ he said ""o my people worship allāh you have no deity other than him there has come to you clear evidence from your lord this is the shecamel of allāh to you as a sign so leave her to eat within allāh's land and do not touch her with harm lest there seize you a painful punishment and remember when he made you successors after the ʿaad and settled you in the land you take for yourselves palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains homes then remember the favors of allāh and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption"" said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people to those who were oppressed to those who believed among them ""do you know that ṣāliḥ is sent from his lord?"" they said ""indeed we in that with which he was sent are believers"" said those who were arrogant ""indeed we in that which you have believed are disbelievers"" so they hamstrung the shecamel and were insolent toward the command of their lord and said ""o ṣāliḥ bring us what you promise us if you should be of the messengers"" so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home fallen prone and he turned away from them and said ""o my people i had certainly conveyed to you the message of my lord and advised you but you do not like advisors"" and lot when he said to his people ""do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds ? indeed you approach men with desire instead of women rather you are a transgressing people"" but the answer of his people was only that they said ""evict them from your city! indeed they are men who keep themselves pure"" so we saved him and his family except for his wife she was of those who remained and we rained upon them a rain then see how was the end of the criminals and to madyan their brother shuʿayb he said ""o my people worship allāh you have no deity other than him there has come to you clear evidence from your lord so fulfill the measure and weight and do not deprive people of their due and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation that is better for you if you should be believers and do not sit on every path threatening and averting from the way of allāh those who believe in him seeking to make it deviant and remember when you were few and he increased you and see how was the end of the corrupters and if there should be a group among you who has believed in that with which i have been sent and a group that has not believed then be patient until allāh judges between us and he is the best of judges"" said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people ""we will surely evict you o shuʿayb and those who have believed with you from our city or you must return to our religion"" he said ""even if we were unwilling? we would have invented against allāh a lie if we returned to your religion after allāh had saved us from it and it is not for us to return to it except that allāh our lord should will our lord has encompassed all things in knowledge upon allāh we have relied our lord decide between us and our people in truth and you are the best of those who give decision"" said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people ""if you should follow shuʿayb indeed you would then be losers"" so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home fallen prone those who denied shuʿayb it was as though they had never resided there those who denied shuʿayb it was they who were the losers and he turned away from them and said ""o my people i had certainly conveyed to you the messages of my lord and advised you so how could i grieve for a disbelieving people?"" and we sent to no city a prophet except that we seized its people with poverty and hardship that they might humble themselves then we exchanged in place of the bad good until they increased and said ""our fathers were touched with hardship and ease"" so we seized them suddenly while they did not perceive and if only the people of the cities had believed and feared allāh we would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth but they denied so we seized them for what they were earning then did the people of the cities feel secure from our punishment coming to them at night while they were asleep? or did the people of the cities feel secure from our punishment coming to them in the morning while they were at play? then did they feel secure from the plan of allāh? but no one feels secure from the plan of allāh except the losing people has it not become clear to those who inherited the earth after its people that if we willed we could afflict them for their sins? but we seal over their hearts so they do not hear those cities we relate to you some of their news and certainly did their messengers come to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before thus does allāh seal over the hearts of the disbelievers and we did not find for most of them any covenant but indeed we found most of them defiantly disobedient then we sent after them moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment but they were unjust toward them so see how was the end of the corrupters and moses said ""o pharaoh i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds obligated not to say about allāh except the truth i have come to you with clear evidence from your lord so send with me the children of israel"" said ""if you have come with a sign then bring it forth if you should be of the truthful"" so he threw his staff and suddenly it was a serpent manifest and he drew out his hand thereupon it was white for the observers said the eminent among the people of pharaoh ""indeed this is a learned magician who wants to expel you from your land so what do you instruct?"" they said ""postpone him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers who will bring you every learned magician"" and the magicians came to pharaoh they said ""indeed for us is a reward if we are the predominant"" he said ""yes and you will be among those made near "" they said ""o moses either you throw or we will be the ones to throw "" he said ""throw"" and when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them and they presented a great magic and we inspired to moses ""throw your staff"" and at once it devoured what they were falsifying so the truth was established and abolished was what they were doing and they were overcome right there and became debased and the magicians fell down in prostration they said ""we have believed in the lord of the worlds the lord of moses and aaron"" said pharaoh ""you believed in him before i gave you permission indeed this is a conspiracy which you conspired in the city to expel therefrom its people but you are going to know i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides then i will surely crucify you all"" they said ""indeed to our lord we will return and you do not resent us except because we believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us our lord pour upon us patience and let us die as muslims "" and the eminent among the people of pharaoh said ""will you leave moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?"" said ""we will kill their sons and keep their women alive and indeed we are subjugators over them"" said moses to his people ""seek help through allāh and be patient indeed the earth belongs to allāh he causes to inherit it whom he wills of his servants and the outcome is for the righteous"" they said ""we have been harmed before you came to us and after you have come to us"" he said ""perhaps your lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land and see how you will do"" and we certainly seized the people of pharaoh with years of famine and a deficiency in fruits that perhaps they would be reminded but when good came to them they said ""this is ours "" and if a bad struck them they saw an evil omen in moses and those with him unquestionably their fortune is with allāh but most of them do not know and they said ""no matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us we will not be believers in you"" so we sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs but they were arrogant and were a criminal people and when the punishment descended upon them they said ""o moses invoke for us your lord by what he has promised you if you remove the punishment from us we will surely believe you and we will send with you the children of israel"" but when we removed the punishment from them until a term which they were to reach then at once they broke their word so we took retribution from them and we drowned them in the sea because they denied our signs and were heedless of them and we caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones which we had blessed and the good word of your lord was fulfilled for the children of israel because of what they had patiently endured and we destroyed that pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building and we took the children of israel across the sea then they came upon a people intent in devotion to idols of theirs they said ""o moses make for us a god just as they have gods"" he said ""indeed you are a people behaving ignorantly indeed those  destroyed is that in which they are and worthless is whatever they were doing"" he said ""is it other than allāh i should desire for you as a god while he has preferred you over the worlds?"" and when we saved you from the people of pharaoh afflicting you with the worst torment killing your sons and keeping your women alive and in that was a great trial from your lord and we made an appointment with moses for thirty nights and perfected them by ten so the term of his lord was completed as forty nights and moses said to his brother aaron ""take my place among my people do right and do not follow the way of the corrupters"" and when moses arrived at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said ""my lord show me that i may look at you"" said ""you will not see me but look at the mountain if it should remain in place then you will see me"" but when his lord appeared to the mountain he rendered it level and moses fell unconscious and when he awoke he said ""exalted are you! i have repented to you and i am the first of the believers"" said ""o moses i have chosen you over the people with my messages and my words so take what i have given you and be among the grateful"" and we wrote for him on the tablets of all things instruction and explanation for all things ""take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it i will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient"" i will turn away from my signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right and if they should see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the way of consciousness they will not adopt it as a way but if they see the way of error they will adopt it as a way that is because they have denied our signs and they were heedless of them those who denied our signs and the meeting of the hereafter their deeds have become worthless are they recompensed except for what they used to do? and the people of moses made after from their ornaments a calf an image having a lowing sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? they took it and they were wrongdoers and when regret overcame them and they saw that they had gone astray they said ""if our lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us we will surely be among the losers"" and when moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said ""how wretched is that by which you have replaced me after were you impatient over the matter of your lord?"" and he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by his head pulling him toward him said ""o son of my mother indeed the people overpowered me and were about to kill me so let not the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me among the wrongdoing people"" said ""my lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful"" indeed those who took the calf will obtain anger from their lord and humiliation in the life of this world and thus do we recompense the inventors but those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed indeed your lord thereafter is forgiving and merciful and when the anger subsided in moses he took up the tablets and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who are fearful of their lord and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment and when the earthquake seized them he said ""my lord if you had willed you could have destroyed them before and me would you destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? this is not but your trial by which you send astray whom you will and guide whom you will you are our protector so forgive us and have mercy upon us and you are the best of forgivers and decree for us in this world good and in the hereafter indeed we have turned back to you"" said ""my punishment i afflict with it whom i will but my mercy encompasses all things"" so i will decree it for those who fear me and give zakāh and those who believe in our verses those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet whom they find written in what they have of the torah and the gospel who enjoins upon them what is right and prohibits them from what is wrong and makes lawful for them what is good and forbids them from what is evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them so they who have believed in him honored him supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him it is those who will be the successful say ""o mankind indeed i am the messenger of allāh to you all to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth there is no deity except him he gives life and causes death"" so believe in allāh and his messenger the unlettered prophet who believes in allāh and his words and follow him that you may be guided and among the people of moses is a community which guides by truth and by it establishes justice and we divided them into twelve descendant tribes nations and we inspired to moses when his people implored him for water ""strike with your staff the stone"" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs every people knew its watering place and we shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails ""eat from the good things with which we have provided you"" and they wronged us not but they were wronging themselves and when it was said to them ""dwell in this city and eat from it wherever you will and say 'relieve us of our burdens ' and enter the gate bowing humbly we will forgive you your sins we will increase the doers of good "" but those who wronged among them changed to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong that they were doing and ask them about the town that was by the sea when they transgressed in the sabbath when their fish came to them openly on their sabbath day and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them thus did we give them trial because they were defiantly disobedient and when a community among them said ""why do you advise a people whom allāh is to destroy or to punish with a severe punishment?"" they said ""to be absolved before your lord and perhaps they may fear him"" and when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we saved those who had forbidden evil and seized those who wronged with a wretched punishment because they were defiantly disobeying so when they were insolent about that which they had been forbidden we said to them ""be apes despised"" and when your lord declared that he would surely send upon them until the day of resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst torment indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful and we divided them throughout the earth into nations of them some were righteous and of them some were otherwise and we tested them with good and bad that perhaps they would return and there followed them successors who inherited the scripture taking the commodities of this lower life and saying ""it will be forgiven for us"" and if an offer like it comes to them they will take it was not the covenant of the scripture taken from them that they would not say about allāh except the truth and they studied what was in it? and the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear allāh so will you not use reason? but those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers and when we raised the mountain above them as if it was a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them ""take what we have given you with determination and remember what is in it that you might fear allāh"" and when your lord took from the children of adam from their loins their descendants and made them testify of themselves ""am i not your lord?"" they said ""yes we have testified""  lest you should say on the day of resurrection ""indeed we were of this unaware"" or you say ""it was only that our fathers associated with allāh before and we were but descendants after them then would you destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?"" and thus do we detail the verses and perhaps they will return and recite to them the news of him to whom we gave our signs but he detached himself from them so satan pursued him and he became of the deviators and if we had willed we could have elevated him thereby but he adhered to the earth and followed his own desire so his example is like that of the dog if you chase him he pants or if you leave him he pants that is the example of the people who denied our signs so relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought how evil an example the people who denied our signs and used to wrong themselves whoever allāh guides he is the guided and whoever he sends astray it is those who are the losers and we have certainly created for hell many of the jinn and mankind they have hearts with which they do not understand they have eyes with which they do not see and they have ears with which they do not hear those are like livestock rather they are more astray it is they who are the heedless and to allāh belong the best names so invoke him by them and leave those who practice deviation concerning his names they will be recompensed for what they have been doing and among those we created is a community which guides by truth and thereby establishes justice but those who deny our signs we will progressively lead them from where they do not know and i will give them time indeed my plan is firm then do they not give thought? there is in their companion no madness he is not but a clear warner do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that allāh has created and that perhaps their appointed time has come near? so in what statement hereafter will they believe? whoever allāh sends astray there is no guide for him and he leaves them in their transgression wandering blindly they ask you about the hour when is its arrival? say ""its knowledge is only with my lord none will reveal its time except him it lays heavily upon the heavens and the earth it will not come upon you except unexpectedly"" they ask you as if you are familiar with it say ""its knowledge is only with allāh but most of the people do not know"" say ""i hold not for myself benefit or harm except what allāh has willed and if i knew the unseen i could have acquired much wealth and no harm would have touched me i am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe"" it is he who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in security with her and when he covers her she carries a light burden and continues therein and when it becomes heavy they both invoke allāh their lord ""if you should give us a good we will surely be among the grateful"" but when he gives them a good they ascribe partners to him concerning that which he has given them exalted is allāh above what they associate with him do they associate with him those who create nothing and they are created? and they are unable to them help nor can they help themselves and if you invite them to guidance they will not follow you it is all the same for you whether you invite them or you are silent indeed those you call upon besides allāh are servants like you so call upon them and let them respond to you if you should be truthful do they have feet by which they walk? or do they have hands by which they strike? or do they have eyes by which they see? or do they have ears by which they hear? say ""call your 'partners' and then conspire against me and give me no respite indeed my protector is allāh who has sent down the book and he is an ally to the righteous and those you call upon besides him are unable to help you nor can they help themselves"" and if you invite them to guidance they do not hear and you see them looking at you while they do not see take what is given freely enjoin what is good and turn away from the ignorant and if an evil suggestion comes to you from satan then seek refuge in allāh indeed he is hearing and knowing indeed those who fear allāh when an impulse touches them from satan they remember and at once they have insight but their brothers they increase them in error then they do not stop short and when you do not bring them a sign they say ""why have you not contrived it?"" say ""i only follow what is revealed to me from my lord this is enlightenment from your lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe"" so when the qur’ān is recited then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy and remember your lord within yourself in humility and in fear without being apparent in speech in the mornings and the evenings and do not be among the heedless indeed those who are near your lord are not prevented by arrogance from his worship and they exalt him and to him they prostrate"
8,31.157894736842106,2368,76,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful they ask you about the bounties say ""the bounties is for allāh and the messenger"" so fear allāh and amend that which is between you and obey allāh and his messenger if you should be believers the believers are only those who when allāh is mentioned their hearts become fearful and when his verses are recited to them it increases them in faith and upon their lord they rely the ones who establish prayer and from what we have provided them they spend those are the believers truly for them are degrees with their lord and forgiveness and noble provision is] just as when your lord brought you out of your home in truth while indeed a party among the believers were unwilling arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear as if they were being driven toward death while they were looking on when allāh promised you one of the two groups that it would be yours and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours but allāh intended to establish the truth by his words and to eliminate the disbelievers that he should establish the truth and abolish falsehood even if the criminals disliked it when you were asking help of your lord and he answered you ""indeed i will reinforce you with a thousand from the angels following one another"" and allāh made it not but good tidings and so that your hearts would be assured thereby and victory is not but from allāh indeed allāh is exalted in might and wise when he overwhelmed you with drowsiness security from him and sent down upon you from the sky rain by which to purify you and remove from you the evil of satan and to make steadfast your hearts and plant firmly thereby your feet when your lord inspired to the angels ""i am with you so strengthen those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved so strike upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip"" that is because they opposed allāh and his messenger and whoever opposes allāh and his messenger indeed allāh is severe in penalty ""that so taste it"" and indeed for the disbelievers is the punishment of the fire o you who have believed when you meet those who disbelieve advancing do not turn to them your backs and whoever turns his back to them on such a day unless swerving for war or joining company has certainly returned with anger from allāh and his refuge is hell and wretched is the destination and you did not kill them but it was allāh who killed them and you threw not when you threw but it was allāh who threw that he might test the believers with a good test indeed allāh is hearing and knowing that and that allāh will weaken the plot of the disbelievers if you seek the decision  the decision has come to you and if you desist it is best for you but if you return we will return and never will you be availed by your company at all even if it should increase and because allāh is with the believers o you who have believed obey allāh and his messenger and do not turn from him while you hear and do not be like those who say ""we have heard"" while they do not hear indeed the worst of living creatures in the sight of allāh are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason had allāh known any good in them he would have made them hear and if he had made them hear they would have turned away while they were refusing o you who have believed respond to allāh and to the messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life and know that allāh intervenes between a man and his heart and that to him you will be gathered and fear a trial which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively and know that allāh is severe in penalty and remember when you were few and oppressed in the land fearing that people might abduct you but he sheltered you supported you with his victory and provided you with good things that you might be grateful o you who have believed do not betray allāh and the messenger or betray your trusts while you know and know that your properties and your children are but a trial and that allāh has with him a great reward o you who have believed if you fear allāh he will grant you a criterion and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you and allāh is the possessor of great bounty and when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you but they plan and allāh plans and allāh is the best of planners and when our verses are recited to them they say ""we have heard if we willed we could say like this this is not but legends of the former peoples"" and when they said ""o allāh if this should be the truth from you then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment"" but allāh would not punish them while you are among them and allāh would not punish them while they seek forgiveness but why should allāh not punish them while they obstruct from almasjid alḥarām and they were not its guardians? its guardians are not but the righteous but most of them do not know and their prayer at the house was not except whistling and handclapping so taste the punishment for what you disbelieved indeed those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert from the way of allāh so they will spend it then it will be for them a regret then they will be overcome and those who have disbelieved unto hell they will be gathered so that allāh may distinguish the wicked from the good and place the wicked some of them upon others and heap them all together and put them into hell it is those who are the losers say to those who have disbelieved if they cease what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them but if they return  then the precedent of the former peoples has already taken place and fight against them until there is no fitnah and the religion all of it is for allāh and if they cease then indeed allāh is seeing of what they do but if they turn away then know that allāh is your protector excellent is the protector and excellent is the helper and know that anything you obtain of war booty then indeed for allāh is one fifth of it and for the messenger and for near relatives and the orphans the needy and the traveler if you have believed in allāh and in that which we sent down to our servant on the day of criterion  the day when the two armies met and allāh over all things is competent when you were on the near side of the valley and they were on the farther side and the caravan was lower than you if you had made an appointment you would have missed the appointment but so that allāh might accomplish a matter already destined that those who perished would perish upon evidence and those who lived would live upon evidence and indeed allāh is hearing and knowing when allāh showed them to you in your dream as few and if he had shown them to you as many you would have lost courage and would have disputed in the matter but allāh saved indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts and when he showed them to you when you met as few in your eyes and he made you as few in their eyes so that allāh might accomplish a matter already destined and to allāh are matters returned o you who have believed when you encounter a company stand firm and remember allāh much that you may be successful and obey allāh and his messenger and do not dispute and lose courage and your strength would depart and be patient indeed allāh is with the patient and do not be like those who came forth from their homes insolently and to be seen by people and avert from the way of allāh and allāh is encompassing of what they do and when satan made their deeds pleasing to them and said ""no one can overcome you today from among the people and indeed i am your protector"" but when the two armies sighted each other he turned on his heels and said ""indeed i am disassociated from you indeed i see what you do not see indeed i fear allāh and allāh is severe in penalty"" when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was disease said ""their religion has deluded those "" but whoever relies upon allāh then indeed allāh is exalted in might and wise and if you could but see when the angels take the souls of those who disbelieved they are striking their faces and their backs and ""taste the punishment of the burning fire that is for what your hands have put forth and because allāh is not ever unjust to servants"" like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they disbelieved in the signs of allāh so allāh seized them for their sins indeed allāh is powerful and severe in penalty that is because allāh would not change a favor which he had bestowed upon a people until they change what is within themselves and indeed allāh is hearing and knowing like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they denied the signs of their lord so we destroyed them for their sins and we drowned the people of pharaoh and all were wrongdoers indeed the worst of living creatures in the sight of allāh are those who have disbelieved and they will not believe the ones with whom you made a treaty but then they break their pledge every time and they do not fear allāh so if you gain dominance over them in war disperse by them those behind them that perhaps they will be reminded if you fear from a people betrayal throw back to them on equal terms indeed allāh does not like traitors and let not those who disbelieve think they will escape indeed they will not cause failure and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allāh and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know whom allāh knows and whatever you spend in the cause of allāh will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged and if they incline to peace then incline to it and rely upon allāh indeed it is he who is the hearing the knowing but if they intend to deceive you then sufficient for you is allāh it is he who supported you with his help and with the believers and brought together their hearts if you had spent all that is in the earth you could not have brought their hearts together but allāh brought them together indeed he is exalted in might and wise o prophet sufficient for you is allāh and for whoever follows you of the believers o prophet urge the believers to battle if there are among you twenty steadfast they will overcome two hundred and if there are among you one hundred they will overcome a thousand of those who have disbelieved because they are a people who do not understand now allāh has lightened for you and he knows that among you is weakness so if there are from you one hundred steadfast they will overcome two hundred and if there are among you a thousand they will overcome two thousand by permission of allāh and allāh is with the steadfast it is not for a prophet to have captives until he inflicts a massacre in the land you desire the commodities of this world but allāh desires the hereafter and allāh is exalted in might and wise if not for a decree from allāh that preceded you would have been touched for what you took by a great punishment so consume what you have taken of war booty lawful and good and fear allāh indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful o prophet say to whoever is in your hands of the captives ""if allāh knows good in your hearts he will give you better than what was taken from you and he will forgive you and allāh is forgiving and merciful"" but if they intend to betray you then they have already betrayed allāh before and he empowered over them and allāh is knowing and wise indeed those who have believed and emigrated and fought with their wealth and lives in the cause of allāh and those who gave shelter and aided they are allies of one another but those who believed and did not emigrate for you there is no support of them until they emigrate and if they seek help of you for the religion then you must help except against a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty and allāh is seeing of what you do and those who disbelieved are allies of one another if you do not do so there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption but those who have believed and emigrated and fought in the cause of allāh and those who gave shelter and aided it is they who are the believers truly for them is forgiveness and noble provision and those who believed after and emigrated and fought with you they are of you but those of relationship are more entitled in the decree of allāh indeed allāh is knowing of all things"
9,37.82170542635659,4879,129,"disassociation from allāh and his messenger to those with whom you had made a treaty among the polytheists so travel freely throughout the land four months but know that you cannot cause failure to allāh and that allāh will disgrace the disbelievers and an announcement from allāh and his messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that allāh is disassociated from the disbelievers and his messenger so if you repent that is best for you but if you turn away then know that you will not cause failure to allāh and give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you so complete for them their treaty until their term indeed allāh loves the righteous and when the inviolable months have passed then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush but if they should repent establish prayer and give zakāh let them on their way indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful and if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of allāh then deliver him to his place of safety that is because they are a people who do not know how can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of allāh and with his messenger except for those with whom you made a treaty at almasjid alḥarām? so as long as they are upright toward you be upright toward them indeed allāh loves the righteous how while if they gain dominance over you they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection? they satisfy you with their mouths but their hearts refuse and most of them are defiantly disobedient they have exchanged the signs of allāh for a small price and averted from his way indeed it was evil that they were doing they do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or covenant of protection and it is they who are the transgressors but if they repent establish prayer and give zakāh then they are your brothers in religion and we detail the verses for a people who know and if they break their oaths after their treaty and defame your religion then combat the leaders of disbelief for indeed there are no oaths to them they might cease would you not fight against a people who broke their oaths and determined to expel the messenger and they had begun you the first time? do you fear them? but allāh has more right that you should fear him if you are believers fight them allāh will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people and remove the fury in their hearts and allāh turns in forgiveness to whom he wills and allāh is knowing and wise do you think that you will be left while allāh has not yet made evident those among you who strive and do not take other than allāh his messenger and the believers as intimates? and allāh is aware of what you do it is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of allāh witnessing against themselves with disbelief those their deeds have become worthless and in the fire they will abide eternally the mosques of allāh are only to be maintained by those who believe in allāh and the last day and establish prayer and give zakāh and do not fear except allāh for it is expected that those will be of the guided have you made the providing of water for the pilgrim and the maintenance of almasjid alḥarām equal to one who believes in allāh and the last day and strives in the cause of allāh? they are not equal in the sight of allāh and allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people the ones who have believed emigrated and striven in the cause of allāh with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of allāh and it is those who are the attainers their lord gives them good tidings of mercy from him and approval and of gardens for them wherein is enduring pleasure abiding therein forever indeed allāh has with him a great reward o you who have believed do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies if they have preferred disbelief over belief and whoever does so among you then it is those who are the wrongdoers say ""if your fathers your sons your brothers your wives your relatives wealth which you have obtained commerce wherein you fear decline and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than allāh and his messenger and jihād in his cause then wait until allāh executes his command and allāh does not guide the defiantly disobedient people"" allāh has already given you victory in many regions and on the day of ḥunayn when your great number pleased you but it did not avail you at all and the earth was confining for you with its vastness then you turned back fleeing then allāh sent down his tranquility upon his messenger and upon the believers and sent down soldiers whom you did not see and punished those who disbelieved and that is the recompense of the disbelievers then allāh will accept repentance after that for whom he wills and allāh is forgiving and merciful o you who have believed indeed the polytheists are unclean so let them not approach almasjid alḥarām after this their year and if you fear privation allāh will enrich you from his bounty if he wills indeed allāh is knowing and wise fight against those who do not believe in allāh or in the last day and who do not consider unlawful what allāh and his messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the scripture  until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled the jews say ""ezra is the son of allāh"" and the christians say ""the messiah is the son of allāh"" that is their statement from their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before may allāh destroy them how are they deluded? they have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides allāh and the messiah the son of mary and they were not commanded except to worship one god there is no deity except him exalted is he above whatever they associate with him they want to extinguish the light of allāh with their mouths but allāh refuses except to perfect his light although the disbelievers dislike it it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion although they who associate others with allāh dislike it o you who have believed indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly and avert from the way of allāh and those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allāh give them tidings of a painful punishment the day when it will be heated in the fire of hell and seared therewith will be their foreheads their flanks and their backs ""this is what you hoarded for yourselves so taste what you used to hoard"" indeed the number of months with allāh is twelve months in the register of allāh the day he created the heavens and the earth of these four are sacred that is the correct religion so do not wrong yourselves during them and fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively and know that allāh is with the righteous indeed the postponing is an increase in disbelief by which those who have disbelieved are led astray they make it lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by allāh and make lawful what allāh has made unlawful made pleasing to them is the evil of their deeds and allāh does not guide the disbelieving people o you who have believed what is with you that when you are told to go forth in the cause of allāh you adhere heavily to the earth? are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the hereafter? but what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the hereafter except a little if you do not go forth he will punish you with a painful punishment and will replace you with another people and you will not harm him at all and allāh is over all things competent if you do not aid him  allāh has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out as one of two when they were in the cave and he said to his companion ""do not grieve indeed allāh is with us"" and allāh sent down his tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest while the word of allāh that is the highest and allāh is exalted in might and wise go forth whether light or heavy and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of allāh that is better for you if you only knew had it been a near gain and a moderate trip they would have followed you but distant to them was the journey and they will swear by allāh ""if we were able we would have gone forth with you"" destroying themselves and allāh knows that indeed they are liars allāh has pardoned you why did you give them permission ? until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew the liars those who believe in allāh and the last day would not ask permission of you to be excused from striving with their wealth and their lives and allāh is knowing of those who fear him only those would ask permission of you who do not believe in allāh and the last day and whose hearts have doubted and they in their doubt are hesitating and if they had intended to go forth they would have prepared for it preparation but allāh disliked their being sent so he kept them back and they were told ""remain with those who remain"" had they gone forth with you they would not have increased you except in confusion and they would have been active among you seeking you fitnah and among you are avid listeners to them and allāh is knowing of the wrongdoers they had already desired dissension before and had upset matters for you until the truth came and the ordinance of allāh appeared while they were averse and among them is he who says ""permit me and do not put me to trial"" unquestionably into trial they have fallen and indeed hell will encompass the disbelievers if good befalls you it distresses them but if disaster strikes you they say ""we took our matter before"" and turn away while they are rejoicing say ""never will we be struck except by what allāh has decreed for us he is our protector"" and upon allāh let the believers rely say ""do you await for us except one of the two best things while we await for you that allāh will afflict you with punishment from himself or at our hands? so wait indeed we along with you are waiting"" say ""spend willingly or unwillingly never will it be accepted from you indeed you have been a defiantly disobedient people"" and what prevents their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they have disbelieved in allāh and in his messenger and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling so let not their wealth or their children impress you allāh only intends to punish them through them in worldly life and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers and they swear by allāh that they are from among you while they are not from among you but they are a people who are afraid if they could find a refuge or some caves or any place to enter they would turn to it while they run heedlessly and among them are some who criticize you concerning the charities if they are given from them they approve but if they are not given from them at once they become angry if only they had been satisfied with what allāh and his messenger gave them and said ""sufficient for us is allāh allāh will give us of his bounty and his messenger indeed we are desirous toward allāh"" zakāh expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed for it and for bringing hearts together and for freeing captives and for those in debt and for the cause of allāh and for the traveler an obligation by allāh and allāh is knowing and wise and among them are those who abuse the prophet and say ""he is an ear"" say "" an ear of goodness for you that believes in allāh and believes the believers and a mercy to those who believe among you"" and those who abuse the messenger of allāh for them is a painful punishment they swear by allāh to you to satisfy you but allāh and his messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy if they were to be believers do they not know that whoever opposes allāh and his messenger that for him is the fire of hell wherein he will abide eternally? that is the great disgrace the hypocrites are apprehensive lest a sūrah be revealed about them informing them of what is in their hearts say ""mock indeed allāh will expose that which you fear"" and if you ask them they will surely say ""we were only conversing and playing"" say ""is it allāh and his verses and his messenger that you were mocking?"" make no excuse you have disbelieved after your belief if we pardon one faction of you we will punish another faction because they were criminals the hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another they enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands they have forgotten allāh so he has forgotten them indeed the hypocrites it is they who are the defiantly disobedient allāh has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of hell wherein they will abide eternally it is sufficient for them and allāh has cursed them and for them is an enduring punishment like those before you they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children they enjoyed their portion and you have enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion and you have engaged like that in which they engaged those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the hereafter and it is they who are the losers has there not reached them the news of those before them the people of noah and ʿaad and thamūd and the people of abraham and the companions of madyan and the towns overturned? their messengers came to them with clear proofs and allāh would never have wronged them but they were wronging themselves the believing men and believing women are allies of one another they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakāh and obey allāh and his messenger those allāh will have mercy upon them indeed allāh is exalted in might and wise allāh has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence but approval from allāh is greater it is that which is the great attainment o prophet fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them and their refuge is hell and wretched is the destination they swear by allāh that they did not say while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their islām and planned that which they were not to attain and they were not resentful except that allāh and his messenger had enriched them of his bounty so if they repent it is better for them but if they turn away allāh will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter and there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper and among them are those who made a covenant with allāh ""if he should give us from his bounty we will surely spend in charity and we will surely be among the righteous"" but when he gave them from his bounty they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused so he penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they will meet him because they failed allāh in what they promised him and because they used to lie did they not know that allāh knows their secrets and their private conversations and that allāh is the knower of the unseen? those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning charities and the ones who find nothing except their effort so they ridicule them allāh will ridicule them and they will have a painful punishment ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them if you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times never will allāh forgive them that is because they disbelieved in allāh and his messenger and allāh does not guide the defiantly disobedient people those who remained behind rejoiced in their staying after the messenger of allāh and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of allāh and said ""do not go forth in the heat"" say ""the fire of hell is more intense in heat"" if they would but understand so let them laugh a little and weep much as recompense for what they used to earn if allāh should return you to a faction of them and then they ask your permission to go out say ""you will not go out with me ever and you will never fight with me an enemy indeed you were satisfied with sitting the first time so sit with those who stay behind"" and do not pray over any of them who has died ever or stand at his grave indeed they disbelieved in allāh and his messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient and let not their wealth and their children impress you allāh only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers and when a sūrah was revealed to believe in allāh and to fight with his messenger those of wealth among them asked your permission and said ""leave us to be with them who sit "" they were satisfied to be with those who stay behind and their hearts were sealed over so they do not understand but the messenger and those who believed with him fought with their wealth and their lives those will have good and it is those who are the successful allāh has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally that is the great attainment and those with excuses among the bedouins came to be permitted and they who had lied to allāh and his messenger sat there will strike those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment there is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort when they are sincere to allāh and his messenger there is not upon the doers of good any cause and allāh is forgiving and merciful nor upon those who when they came to you for you to take them along you said ""i can find nothing upon which to carry you"" they turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find something to spend the cause is only upon those who ask permission of you while they are rich they are satisfied to be with those who stay behind and allāh has sealed over their hearts so they do not know they will make excuses to you when you have returned to them say ""make no excuse never will we believe you allāh has already informed us of your news and allāh will observe your deeds and his messenger then you will be taken back to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you of what you used to do"" they will swear by allāh to you when you return to them that you would leave them alone so leave them alone indeed they are evil and their refuge is hell as recompense for what they had been earning they swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them but if you should be satisfied with them indeed allāh is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people the bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits of what allāh has revealed to his messenger and allāh is knowing and wise and among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss and await for you turns of misfortune upon them will be a misfortune of evil and allāh is hearing and knowing but among the bedouins are some who believe in allāh and the last day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to allāh and of invocations of the messenger unquestionably it is a means of nearness for them allāh will admit them to his mercy indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful and the first forerunners among the muhājireen and the anṣār and those who followed them with good conduct allāh is pleased with them and they are pleased with him and he has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever that is the great attainment and among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites and from the people of madīnah they have persisted in hypocrisy you do not know them we know them we will punish them twice then they will be returned to a great punishment and others who have acknowledged their sins they had mixed a righteous deed with another that was bad perhaps allāh will turn to them in forgiveness indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful take from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase and invoke upon them indeed your invocations are reassurance for them and allāh is hearing and knowing do they not know that it is allāh who accepts repentance from his servants and receives charities and that it is allāh who is the accepting of repentance the merciful? and say ""do for allāh will see your deeds and his messenger and the believers and you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you of what you used to do"" and others deferred until the command of allāh whether he will punish them or whether he will forgive them and allāh is knowing and wise and those who took for themselves a mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against allāh and his messenger before and they will surely swear ""we intended only the best"" and allāh testifies that indeed they are liars do not stand within it ever a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in within it are men who love to purify themselves and allāh loves those who purify themselves then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness from allāh and his approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse so it collapsed with him into the fire of hell? and allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people their building which they built will not cease to be a skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are cut and allāh is knowing and wise indeed allāh has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties for that they will have paradise they fight in the cause of allāh so they kill and are killed a true promise upon him in the torah and the gospel and the qur’ān and who is truer to his covenant than allāh? so rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted and it is that which is the great attainment the repentant the worshippers the praisers the travelers those who bow and prostrate those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and those who observe the limits allāh and give good tidings to the believers it is not for the prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they were relatives after it has become clear to them that they are companions of hellfire and the request of forgiveness of abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him but when it became apparent to him that he was an enemy to allāh he disassociated himself from him indeed was abraham compassionate and patient and allāh would not let a people stray after he has guided them until he makes clear to them what they should avoid indeed allāh is knowing of all things indeed to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he gives life and causes death and you have not besides allāh any protector or any helper allāh has already forgiven the prophet and the muhājireen and the anṣār who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a party of them had almost inclined and then he forgave them indeed he was to them kind and merciful and the three who were left alone to the point that the earth closed in on them in spite of its vastness and their souls confined them and they were certain that there is no refuge from allāh except in him then he turned to them so they could repent indeed allāh is the accepting of repentance the merciful o you who have believed fear allāh and be with those who are true it was not for the people of madīnah and those surrounding them of the bedouins that they remain behind after the messenger of allāh or that they prefer themselves over his self that is because they are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of allāh nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers nor do they inflict upon an enemy any infliction but that it is registered for them as a righteous deed indeed allāh does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good nor do they spend an expenditure small or large or cross a valley but that it is registered for them that allāh may reward them for the best of what they were doing and it is not for the believers to go forth all at once for there should separate from every division of them a group to obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they might be cautious o you who have believed fight against those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness and know that allāh is with the righteous and whenever a sūrah is revealed there are among them those who say ""which of you has this increased in faith?"" as for those who believed it has increased them in faith while they are rejoicing but as for those in whose hearts is disease it has increased them in evil to their evil and they will have died while they are disbelievers do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice but then they do not repent nor do they remember? and whenever a sūrah is revealed they look at each other ""does anyone see you?"" and then they dismiss themselves allāh has dismissed their hearts because they are a people who do not understand there has certainly come to you a messenger from among yourselves grievous to him is what you suffer concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful but if they turn away say ""sufficient for me is allāh there is no deity except him on him i have relied and he is the lord of the great throne"""
10,31.490909090909092,3464,110,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful alif lām rā these are the verses of the wise book have the people been amazed that we revealed to a man from among them ""warn mankind and give good tidings to those who believe that they will have a precedence of honor with their lord""? the disbelievers say ""indeed this is an obvious magician"" indeed your lord is allāh who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established himself above the throne arranging the matter there is no intercessor except after his permission that is allāh your lord so worship him then will you not remember? to him is your return all together the promise of allāh truth indeed he begins the creation and then repeats it that he may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds in justice but those who disbelieved will have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to deny it is he who made the sun a shining light and the moon a derived light and determined for it phases that you may know the number of years and account allāh has not created this except in truth he details the signs for a people who know indeed in the alternation of the night and the day and what allāh has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear allāh indeed those who do not expect the meeting with us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein and those who are heedless of our signs for those their refuge will be the fire because of what they used to earn indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds their lord will guide them because of their faith beneath them rivers will flow in the gardens of pleasure their call therein will be ""exalted are you o allāh"" and their greeting therein will be ""peace"" and the last of their call will be ""praise to allāh lord of the worlds!"" and if allāh was to hasten for the people the evil as he hastens for them the good their term would have been ended for them but we leave the ones who do not expect the meeting with us in their transgression wandering blindly and when affliction touches man he calls upon us whether lying on his side or sitting or standing but when we remove from him his affliction he continues as if he had never called upon us to an affliction that touched him thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing and we had already destroyed generations before you when they wronged and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe thus do we recompense the criminal people then we made you successors in the land after them so that we may observe how you will do and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who do not expect the meeting with us say ""bring us a qur’ān other than this or change it"" say ""it is not for me to change it on my own accord i only follow what is revealed to me indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day"" say ""if allāh had willed i would not have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you for i had remained among you a lifetime before it then will you not reason?"" so who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about allāh or denies his signs? indeed the criminals will not succeed and they worship other than allāh that which neither harms them nor benefits them and they say ""these are our intercessors with allāh"" say ""do you inform allāh of something he does not know in the heavens or on the earth?"" exalted is he and high above what they associate with him and mankind was not but one community but they differed and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them concerning that over which they differ and they say ""why is a sign not sent down to him from his lord?"" so say ""the unseen is only for allāh so wait indeed i am with you among those who wait"" and when we give the people a taste of mercy after adversity has touched them at once they conspire against our verses say ""allāh is swifter in strategy"" indeed our messengers record that which you conspire it is he who enables you to travel on land and sea until when you are in ships and they sail with them by a good wind and they rejoice therein there comes a storm wind and the waves come upon them from every place and they expect to be engulfed they supplicate allāh sincere to him in religion ""if you should save us from this we will surely be among the thankful"" but when he saves them at once they commit injustice upon the earth without right o mankind your injustice is only against yourselves the enjoyment of worldly life then to us is your return and we will inform you of what you used to do the example of worldly life is but like rain which we have sent down from the sky that the plants of the earth absorb  from which men and livestock eat until when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people suppose that they have capability over it there comes to it our command by night or by day and we make it as a harvest as if it had not flourished yesterday thus do we explain in detail the signs for a people who give thought and allāh invites to the home of peace and guides whom he wills to a straight path for them who have done good is the best  and extra no darkness will cover their faces nor humiliation those are companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally but they who have earned evil doings the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent and humiliation will cover them they will have from allāh no protector it will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night so dark those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally and the day we will gather them all together then we will say to those who associated others with allāh "" your place you and your 'partners'"" then we will separate them and their ""partners"" will say ""you did not used to worship us and sufficient is allāh as a witness between us and you that we were of your worship unaware"" there every soul will be put to trial for what it did previously and they will be returned to allāh their master the truth and lost from them is whatever they used to invent say ""who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges matter?"" they will say ""allāh"" so say ""then will you not fear him?"" for that is allāh your lord the truth and what can be beyond truth except error? so how are you averted? thus the word of your lord has come into effect upon those who defiantly disobeyed that they will not believe say ""are there of your 'partners' any who begins creation and then repeats it?"" say ""allāh begins creation and then repeats it so how are you deluded?"" say ""are there of your 'partners' any who guides to the truth?"" say ""allāh guides to the truth so is he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless he is guided? then what is with you how do you judge?"" and most of them follow not except assumption indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all indeed allāh is knowing of what they do and it was not for this qur’ān to be produced by other than allāh but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the scripture about which there is no doubt from the lord of the worlds or do they say ""he invented it?"" say ""then bring forth a sūrah like it and call upon whomever you can besides allāh if you should be truthful"" rather they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet come to them thus did those before them deny then observe how was the end of the wrongdoers and of them are those who believe in it and of them are those who do not believe in it and your lord is most knowing of the corrupters and if they deny you then say ""for me are my deeds and for you are your deeds you are disassociated from what i do and i am disassociated from what you do"" and among them are those who listen to you but can you cause the deaf to hear although they will not use reason? and among them are those who look at you but can you guide the blind although they will not see? indeed allāh does not wrong the people at all but it is the people who are wronging themselves and on the day when he will gather them as if they had not remained but an hour of the day they will know each other those will have lost who denied the meeting with allāh and were not guided and whether we show you some of what we promise them or we take you in death to us is their return then allāh is a witness concerning what they are doing and for every nation is a messenger so when their messenger comes it will be judged between them in justice and they will not be wronged and they say ""when is this promise if you should be truthful?"" say ""i possess not for myself any harm or benefit except what allāh should will for every nation is a term when their time has come then they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede "" say ""have you considered if his punishment should come to you by night or by day for which of it would the criminals be impatient?"" then is it that when it has occurred you will believe in it? now? and you were for it impatient then it will be said to those who had wronged ""taste the punishment of eternity are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?"" and they ask information of you ""is it true?"" say ""yes by my lord indeed it is truth and you will not cause failure "" and if each soul that wronged had everything on earth it would offer it in ransom and they will confide regret when they see the punishment and they will be judged in justice and they will not be wronged unquestionably to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth unquestionably the promise of allāh is truth but most of them do not know he gives life and causes death and to him you will be returned o mankind there has come to you instruction from your lord and healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the believers say ""in the bounty of allāh and in his mercy in that let them rejoice it is better than what they accumulate"" say ""have you seen what allāh has sent down to you of provision of which you have made lawful and unlawful?"" say ""has allāh permitted you or do you invent about allāh?"" and what will be the supposition of those who invent falsehood about allāh on the day of resurrection? indeed allāh is the possessor of bounty for the people but most of them are not grateful and you are not in any matter and do not recite any of the qur’ān and you do not do any deed except that we are witness over you when you are involved in it and not absent from your lord is any of an atom's weight within the earth or within the heaven or smaller than that or greater but that it is in a clear register unquestionably the allies of allāh there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve those who believed and were fearing allāh for them are good tidings in the worldly life and in the hereafter no change is there in the words of allāh that is what is the great attainment and let not their speech grieve you indeed honor belongs to allāh entirely he is the hearing the knowing unquestionably to allāh belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and those who invoke other than allāh do not follow ""partners"" they follow not except assumption and they are not but misjudging it is he who made for you the night to rest therein and the day giving sight indeed in that are signs for a people who listen they have said ""allāh has taken a son"" exalted is he he is the free of need to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth you have no authority for this do you say about allāh that which you do not know? say ""indeed those who invent falsehood about allāh will not succeed"" enjoyment in this world then to us is their return then we will make them taste the severe punishment because they used to disbelieve and recite to them the news of noah when he said to his people ""o my people if my residence and my reminding of the signs of allāh has become burdensome upon you then i have relied upon allāh so resolve upon your plan and your associates then let not your plan be obscure to you then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite and if you turn away  then no payment have i asked of you my reward is only from allāh and i have been commanded to be of the muslims "" and they denied him so we saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors and we drowned those who denied our signs then see how was the end of those who were warned then we sent after him messengers to their peoples and they came to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before thus we seal over the hearts of the transgressors then we sent after them moses and aaron to pharaoh and his establishment with our signs but they behaved arrogantly and were a criminal people so when there came to them the truth from us they said ""indeed this is obvious magic"" moses said ""do you say about the truth when it has come to you? is this magic? but magicians will not succeed"" they said ""have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may have grandeur in the land? and we are not believers in you"" and pharaoh said ""bring to me every learned magician"" so when the magicians came moses said to them ""throw down whatever you will throw"" and when they had thrown moses said ""what you have brought is magic indeed allāh will expose its worthlessness indeed allāh does not amend the work of corrupters and allāh will establish the truth by his words even if the criminals dislike it"" but no one believed moses except offspring among his people for fear of pharaoh and his establishment that they would persecute them and indeed pharaoh was haughty within the land and indeed he was of the transgressors and moses said ""o my people if you have believed in allāh then rely upon him if you should be muslims "" so they said ""upon allāh do we rely our lord make us not trial for the wrongdoing people and save us by your mercy from the disbelieving people"" and we inspired to moses and his brother ""settle your people in egypt in houses and make your houses qiblah and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers"" and moses said ""our lord indeed you have given pharaoh and his establishment splendor and wealth in the worldly life our lord that they may lead astray from your way our lord obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment"" said ""your supplication has been answered"" so remain on a right course and follow not the way of those who do not know"" and we took the children of israel across the sea and pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until when drowning overtook him he said ""i believe that there is no deity except that in whom the children of israel believe and i am of the muslims"" now? and you had disobeyed before and were of the corrupters? so today we will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign and indeed many among the people of our signs are heedless and we had certainly settled the children of israel in an agreeable settlement and provided them with good things and they did not differ until knowledge had come to them indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ so if you are in doubt about that which we have revealed to you then ask those who have been reading the scripture before you the truth has certainly come to you from your lord so never be among the doubters and never be of those who deny the signs of allāh and be among the losers indeed those upon whom the word of your lord has come into effect will not believe even if every sign should come to them until they see the painful punishment then has there not been a city that believed so its faith benefited it except the people of jonah? when they believed we removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly life and gave them enjoyment for a time and had your lord willed those on earth would have believed all of them entirely then would you compel the people in order that they become believers? and it is not for a soul to believe except by permission of allāh and he will place defilement upon those who will not use reason say ""observe what is in the heavens and the earth"" but of no avail will be signs or warners to a people who do not believe so do they wait except for like the days of those who passed on before them? say ""then wait indeed i am with you among those who wait"" then we will save our messengers and those who have believed thus it is an obligation upon us that we save the believers say ""o people if you are in doubt as to my religion then i do not worship those which you worship besides allāh but i worship allāh who causes your death and i have been commanded to be of the believers and 'direct your face toward the religion inclining to truth and never be of those who associate others with allāh and do not invoke besides allāh that which neither benefits you nor harms you for if you did then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers'"" and if allāh should touch you with adversity there is no remover of it except him and if he intends for you good then there is no repeller of his bounty he causes it to reach whom he wills of his servants and he is the forgiving the merciful say ""o mankind the truth has come to you from your lord so whoever is guided is only guided for his soul and whoever goes astray only goes astray against it and i am not over you a manager"" and follow what is revealed to you and be patient until allāh will judge and he is the best of judges"

indeed this is an amazing thing!"" they said ""are you amazed at the decree of allāh? may the mercy of allāh and his blessings be upon you people of the house indeed he is praiseworthy and honorable"" and when the fright had left abraham and the good tidings had reached him he began to argue with us concerning the people of lot indeed abraham was forbearing grieving and returning ""o abraham give up this indeed the command of your lord has come and indeed there will reach them a punishment that cannot be repelled"" and when our messengers came to lot he was anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort and said ""this is a trying day"" and his people came hastening to him and before they had been doing evil deeds he said ""o my people these are my daughters they are purer for you so fear allāh and do not disgrace me concerning my guests is there not among you a man of reason?"" they said ""you have already known that we have not concerning your daughters any claim and indeed you know what we want"" he said ""if only i had against you some power or could take refuge in a strong support"" they said ""o lot indeed we are messengers of your lord they will never reach you so set out with your family during a portion of the night and let not any among you look back except your wife indeed she will be struck by that which strikes them indeed their appointment is the morning is not the morning near?"" so when our command came we made the highest part its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay marked from your lord and it is not from the wrongdoers far and to madyan their brother shuʿayb he said ""o my people worship allāh you have no deity other than him and do not decrease from the measure and the scale indeed i see you in prosperity but indeed i fear for you the punishment of an allencompassing day and o my people give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption what remains from allāh is best for you if you would be believers but i am not a guardian over you"" they said ""o shuʿayb does your prayer command you that we should leave what our fathers worship or not do with our wealth what we please? indeed you are the forbearing the discerning!"" he said ""o my people have you considered if i am upon clear evidence from my lord and he has provided me with a good provision from him? and i do not intend to differ from you in that which i have forbidden you i only intend reform as much as i am able and my success is not but through allāh upon him i have relied and to him i return and o my people let not dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of noah or the people of hūd or the people of ṣāliḥ and the people of lot are not from you far away and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him indeed my lord is merciful and affectionate"" they said ""o shuʿayb we do not understand much of what you say and indeed we consider you among us as weak and if not for your family we would have stoned you and you are not to us one respected"" he said ""o my people is my family more respected for power by you than allāh? but you put him behind your backs indeed my lord is encompassing of what you do and o my people work according to your position indeed i am working you are going to know to whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar so watch indeed i am with you a watcher "" and when our command came we saved shuʿayb and those who believed with him by mercy from us and the shriek seized those who had wronged and they became within their homes fallen prone as if they had never prospered therein then away with madyan as thamūd was taken away and we did certainly send moses with our signs and a clear authority to pharaoh and his establishment but they followed the command of pharaoh and the command of pharaoh was not discerning he will precede his people on the day of resurrection and lead them into the fire and wretched is the place to which they are led and they were followed in this with a curse and on the day of resurrection and wretched is the gift which is given that is from the news of the cities which we relate to you of them some are standing and some are a harvest and we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves and they were not availed at all by their gods which they invoked other than allāh when there came the command of your lord and they did not increase them in other than ruin and thus is the seizure of your lord when he seizes the cities while they are committing wrong indeed his seizure is painful and severe indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the hereafter that is a day for which the people will be collected and that is a day witnessed and we do not delay it except for a limited term the day it comes no soul will speak except by his permission and among them will be the wretched and the prosperous as for those who were wretched they will be in the fire for them therein is exhaling and inhaling abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except what your lord should will indeed your lord is an effecter of what he intends and as for those who were prosperous they will be in paradise abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except what your lord should will a bestowal uninterrupted so do not be in doubt as to what these are worshipping they worship not except as their fathers worshipped before and indeed we will give them their share undiminished and we had certainly given moses the scripture but it came under disagreement and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them and indeed they are concerning it in disquieting doubt and indeed each  your lord will fully compensate them for their deeds indeed he is aware of what they do so remain on a right course as you have been commanded and those who have turned back with you and do not transgress indeed he is seeing of what you do and do not incline toward those who do wrong lest you be touched by the fire and you would not have other than allāh any protectors then you would not be helped and establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night indeed good deeds do away with misdeeds that is a reminder for those who remember and be patient for indeed allāh does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good so why were there not among the generations before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth except a few of those we saved from among them? but those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given therein and they were criminals and your lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were reformers and if your lord had willed he could have made mankind one community but they will not cease to differ except whom your lord has given mercy and for that he created them but the word of your lord is to be fulfilled that ""i will surely fill hell with jinn and men all together"" and each we relate to you from the news of the messengers is that by which we make firm your heart and there has come to you in this the truth and an instruction and a reminder for the believers and say to those who do not believe ""work according to your position indeed we are working and wait indeed we are waiting"" and to allāh belong the unseen of the heavens and the earth and to him will be returned the matter all of it so worship him and rely upon him and your lord is not unaware of that which you do"
12,30.607142857142858,3428,112,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful alif lām rā these are the verses of the clear book indeed we have sent it down as an arabic qur’ān that you might understand we relate to you the best of stories in what we have revealed to you of this qur’ān although you were before it among the unaware when joseph said to his father ""o my father indeed i have seen eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating to me"" he said ""o my son do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan indeed satan to man is a manifest enemy and thus will your lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete his favor upon you and upon the family of jacob as he completed it upon your fathers before abraham and isaac indeed your lord is knowing and wise"" certainly were there in joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask when they said ""joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we while we are a clan indeed our father is in clear error kill joseph or cast him out to land the countenance of your father will be only for you and you will be after that a righteous people"" said a speaker among them ""do not kill joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well some travelers will pick him up if you would do "" they said ""o our father why do you not entrust us with joseph while indeed we are to him sincere counselors? send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play and indeed we will be his guardians"" said ""indeed it saddens me that you should take him and i fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware"" they said ""if a wolf should eat him while we are a clan indeed we would then be losers"" so when they took him and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well but we inspired to him ""you will surely inform them about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive "" and they came to their father at night weeping they said ""o our father indeed we went racing each other and left joseph with our possessions and a wolf ate him but you would not believe us even if we were truthful"" and they brought upon his shirt false blood said ""rather your souls have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting and allāh is the one sought for help against that which you describe"" and there came a company of travelers then they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket he said ""good news! here is a boy"" and they concealed him as merchandise and allāh was knowing of what they did and they sold him for a reduced price a few dirhams and they were concerning him of those content with little and the one from egypt who bought him said to his wife ""make his residence comfortable perhaps he will benefit us or we will adopt him as a son"" and thus we established joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of events and allāh is predominant over his affair but most of the people do not know and when he reached maturity we gave him judgement and knowledge and thus we reward the doers of good and she in whose house he was sought to seduce him she closed the doors and said ""come you"" he said "" the refuge of allāh indeed he is my master who has made good my residence indeed wrongdoers will not succeed"" and she certainly determined him and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his lord and thus that we should avert from him evil and immorality indeed he was of our chosen servants and they both raced to the door and she tore his shirt from the back and they found her husband at the door she said ""what is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?"" said ""it was she who sought to seduce me"" and a witness from her family testified ""if his shirt is torn from the front then she has told the truth and he is of the liars but if his shirt is torn from the back then she has lied and he is of the truthful"" so when he saw his shirt torn from the back he said ""indeed it is of your plan indeed your plan is great joseph ignore this and ask forgiveness for your sin indeed you were of the sinful"" and women in the city said ""the wife of alʿazeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy he has impassioned her with love indeed we see her in clear error"" so when she heard of their scheming she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said ""come out before them"" and when they saw him they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said ""perfect is allāh! this is not a man this is none but a noble angel"" she said ""that is the one about whom you blamed me and i certainly sought to seduce him but he firmly refused and if he will not do what i order him he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased"" he said ""my lord prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me and if you do not avert from me their plan i might incline toward them and be of the ignorant"" so his lord responded to him and averted from him their plan indeed he is the hearing the knowing then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that he should surely imprison him for a time and there entered the prison with him two young men one of them said ""indeed i have seen myself pressing wine"" the other said ""indeed i have seen myself carrying upon my head bread from which the birds were eating inform us of its interpretation indeed we see you to be of those who do good"" he said ""you will not receive food that is provided to you except that i will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you that is from what my lord has taught me indeed i have left the religion of a people who do not believe in allāh and they in the hereafter are disbelievers and i have followed the religion of my fathers abraham isaac and jacob and it was not for us to associate anything with allāh that is from the favor of allāh upon us and upon the people but most of the people are not grateful o two companions of prison are separate lords better or allāh the one the prevailing? you worship not besides him except names you have named them you and your fathers for which allāh has sent down no evidence legislation is not but for allāh he has commanded that you worship not except him that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know o two companions of prison as for one of you he will give drink to his master of wine but as for the other he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head the matter has been decreed about which you both inquire"" and he said to the one whom he knew would go free ""mention me before your master"" but satan made him forget the mention his master and he remained in prison several years and the king said ""indeed i have seen seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean and seven green spikes and others dry o eminent ones explain to me my vision if you should interpret visions"" they said "" a mixture of false dreams and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams"" but the one who was freed and remembered after a time said ""i will inform you of its interpretation so send me forth"" ""joseph o man of truth explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven lean and seven green spikes and others dry that i may return to the people perhaps they will know "" said ""you will plant for seven years consecutively and what you harvest leave in its spikes except a little from which you will eat then will come after that seven difficult which will consume what you advanced for them except a little from which you will store then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press "" and the king said ""bring him to me"" but when the messenger came to him said ""return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands indeed my lord is knowing of their plan"" said ""what was your condition when you sought to seduce joseph?"" they said ""perfect is allāh! we know about him no evil"" the wife of alʿazeez said ""now the truth has become evident it was i who sought to seduce him and indeed he is of the truthful that is so he will know that i did not betray him in absence and that allāh does not guide the plan of betrayers and i do not acquit myself indeed the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil except those upon which my lord has mercy indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful"" and the king said ""bring him to me i will appoint him exclusively for myself"" and when he spoke to him he said ""indeed you are today established and trusted"" said ""appoint me over the storehouses of the land indeed i will be a knowing guardian"" and thus we established joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed we touch with our mercy whom we will and we do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing allāh and the brothers of joseph came and they entered upon him and he recognized them but he was to them unknown and when he had furnished them with their supplies he said ""bring me a brother of yours from your father do you not see that i give full measure and that i am the best of accommodators? but if you do not bring him to me no measure will there be for you from me nor will you approach me"" they said ""we will attempt to dissuade his father from him and indeed we will do "" and said to his servants ""put their merchandise into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will return"" so when they returned to their father they said ""o our father measure has been denied to us so send with us our brother we will be given measure and indeed we will be his guardians"" he said ""should i entrust you with him except as i entrusted you with his brother before? but allāh is the best guardian and he is the most merciful of the merciful"" and when they opened their baggage they found their merchandise returned to them they said ""o our father what could we desire? this is our merchandise returned to us and we will obtain supplies for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load that is an easy measurement"" said ""never will i send him with you until you give me a promise by allāh that you will bring him to me unless you should be surrounded "" and when they had given their promise he said ""allāh over what we say is entrusted"" and he said ""o my sons do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates and i cannot avail you against allāh at all the decision is only for allāh upon him i have relied and upon him let those who would rely rely"" and when they entered from where their father had ordered them it did not avail them against allāh at all except a need within the soul of jacob which he satisfied and indeed he was a possessor of knowledge because of what we had taught him but most of the people do not know and when they entered upon joseph he took his brother to himself he said ""indeed i am your brother so do not despair over what they used to do "" so when he had furnished them with their supplies he put the bowl into the bag of his brother then an announcer called out ""o caravan indeed you are thieves"" they said while approaching them ""what is it you are missing?"" they said ""we are missing the measure of the king and for he who produces it is a camel's load and i am responsible for it"" they said ""by allāh you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land and we have not been thieves"" they said ""then what would be its recompense if you should be liars?"" said ""its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found he will be its recompense thus do we recompense the wrongdoers"" so he began with their bags before the bag of his brother then he extracted it from the bag of his brother thus did we plan for joseph he could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that allāh willed we raise in degrees whom we will but over every possessor of knowledge is one knowing they said ""if he steals a brother of his has stolen before"" but joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them he said ""you are worse in position and allāh is most knowing of what you describe"" they said ""o ʿazeez indeed he has a father an old man so take one of us in place of him indeed we see you as a doer of good"" he said "" the refuge of allāh that we take except him with whom we found our possession indeed we would then be unjust"" so when they had despaired of him they secluded themselves in private consultation the eldest of them said ""do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by allāh and before you failed in joseph? so i will never leave land until my father permits me or allāh decides for me and he is the best of judges return to your father and say 'o our father indeed your son has stolen and we did not testify except to what we knew and we were not witnesses of the unseen and ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came and indeed we are truthful'"" said ""rather your souls have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting perhaps allāh will bring them to me all together indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise"" and he turned away from them and said ""oh my sorrow over joseph"" and his eyes became white from grief for he was a suppressor they said ""by allāh you will not cease remembering joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish"" he said ""i only complain of my suffering and my grief to allāh and i know from allāh that which you do not know o my sons go and find out about joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from allāh indeed no one despairs of relief from allāh except the disbelieving people"" so when they entered upon him they said ""o ʿazeez adversity has touched us and our family and we have come with goods poor in quality but give us full measure and be charitable to us indeed allāh rewards the charitable"" he said ""do you know what you did with joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?"" they said ""are you indeed joseph?"" he said ""i am joseph and this is my brother allāh has certainly favored us indeed he who fears allāh and is patient then indeed allāh does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good"" they said ""by allāh certainly has allāh preferred you over us and indeed we have been sinners"" he said ""no blame will there be upon you today may allāh forgive you and he is the most merciful of the merciful take this my shirt and cast it over the face of my father he will become seeing and bring me your family all together"" and when the caravan departed their father said ""indeed i find the smell of joseph if you did not think me weakened in mind"" they said ""by allāh indeed you are in your old error"" and when the bearer of good tidings arrived he cast it over his face and he returned seeing he said ""did i not tell you that i know from allāh that which you do not know?"" they said ""o our father ask for us forgiveness of our sins indeed we have been sinners"" he said ""i will ask forgiveness for you from my lord indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful"" and when they entered upon joseph he took his parents to himself and said ""enter egypt allāh willing safe "" and he raised his parents upon the throne and they bowed to him in prostration and he said ""o my father this is the explanation of my vision of before my lord has made it reality and he was certainly good to me when he took me out of prison and brought you from bedouin life after satan had induced between me and my brothers indeed my lord is subtle in what he wills indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise my lord you have given me of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams creator of the heavens and earth you are my protector in this world and the hereafter cause me to die a muslim and join me with the righteous"" that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you and you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired and most of the people although you strive are not believers and you do not ask of them for it any payment it is not except a reminder to the worlds and how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they therefrom are turning away and most of them believe not in allāh except while they associate others with him then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an overwhelming of the punishment of allāh or that the hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive? say ""this is my way i invite to allāh with insight i and those who follow me and exalted is allāh and i am not of those who associate others with him"" and we sent not before you except men to whom we revealed from among the people of cities so have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? and the home of the hereafter is best for those who fear allāh then will you not reason? until when the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied there came to them our victory and whoever we willed was saved and our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals there was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding never was it a narration invented but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe"

and allāh decides there is no adjuster of his decision and he is swift in account and those before them had plotted but to allāh belongs the plan entirely he knows what every soul earns and the disbelievers will know for whom is the final home and those who have disbelieved say ""you are not a messenger"" say ""sufficient is allāh as witness between me and you and whoever has knowledge of the scripture"""

he invites you that he may forgive you of your sins and he delays you for a specified term"" they said ""you are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping so bring us a clear authority "" their messengers said to them ""we are only men like you but allāh confers favor upon whom he wills of his servants it has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of allāh and upon allāh let the believers rely and why should we not rely upon allāh while he has guided us to our ways and we will surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us and upon allāh let those who would rely rely"" and those who disbelieved said to their messengers ""we will surely drive you out of our land or you must return to our religion"" so their lord inspired to them ""we will surely destroy the wrongdoers and we will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them that is for he who fears my position and fears my threat"" and they requested decision and disappointed was every obstinate tyrant before him is hell and he will be given a drink of purulent water he will gulp it but will hardly swallow it and death will come to him from everywhere but he is not to die and before him is a massive punishment the example of those who disbelieve in their lord is their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day they are unable from what they earned a thing that is what is extreme error have you not seen that allāh created the heavens and the earth in truth? if he wills he can do away with you and produce a new creation and that is not difficult for allāh and they will come out before allāh all together and the weak will say to those who were arrogant ""indeed we were your followers so can you avail us anything against the punishment of allāh?"" they will say ""if allāh had guided us we would have guided you it is all the same for us whether we show intolerance or are patient there is for us no place of escape"" and satan will say when the matter has been concluded ""indeed allāh had promised you the promise of truth and i promised you but i betrayed you but i had no authority over you except that i invited you and you responded to me so do not blame me but blame yourselves i cannot be called to your aid nor can you be called to my aid indeed i deny your association of me before indeed for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment"" and those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein by permission of their lord and their greeting therein will be ""peace!"" have you not considered how allāh presents an example a good word like a good tree whose root is firmly fixed and its branches in the sky? it produces its fruit all the time by permission of its lord and allāh presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded and the example of a bad word is like a bad tree uprooted from the surface of the earth not having any stability allāh keeps firm those who believe with the firm word in worldly life and in the hereafter and allāh sends astray the wrongdoers and allāh does what he wills have you not considered those who exchanged the favor of allāh for disbelief and settled their people the home of ruin? hell which they will burn and wretched is the settlement and they have attributed to allāh equals to mislead from his way say ""enjoy yourselves for indeed your destination is the fire"" tell my servants who have believed to establish prayer and spend from what we have provided them secretly and publicly before a day comes in which there will be no exchange nor any friendships it is allāh who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by his command and subjected for you the rivers and he subjected for you the sun and the moon continuous and subjected for you the night and the day and he gave you from all you asked of him and if you should count the favor of allāh you could not enumerate them indeed mankind is most unjust and ungrateful and when abraham said ""my lord make this city secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols my lord indeed they have led astray many among the people so whoever follows me then he is of me and whoever disobeys me indeed you are forgiving and merciful our lord i have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near your sacred house our lord that they may establish prayer so make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful our lord indeed you know what we conceal and what we declare and nothing is hidden from allāh on the earth or in the heaven praise to allāh who has granted to me in old age ishmael and isaac indeed my lord is the hearer of supplication my lord make me an establisher of prayer and from my descendants our lord and accept my supplication our lord forgive me and my parents and the believers the day the account is established"" and never think that allāh is unaware of what the wrongdoers do he only delays them for a day when eyes will stare racing ahead their heads raised up their glance does not come back to them and their hearts are void and warn the people of a day when the punishment will come to them and those who did wrong will say ""our lord delay us for a short term we will answer your call and follow the messengers"" ""had you not sworn before that for you there would be no cessation? and you lived among the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it had become clear to you how we dealt with them and we presented for you examples"" and they had planned their plan but with allāh is their plan even if their plan had been to do away with the mountains so never think that allāh will fail in his promise to his messengers indeed allāh is exalted in might and owner of retribution on the day the earth will be replaced by another earth and the heavens and they will come out before allāh the one the prevailing and you will see the criminals that day bound together in irons their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the fire so that allāh will recompense every soul for what it earned indeed allāh is swift in account this is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that he is but one god and that those of understanding will be reminded"

then of what do you inform?"" they said ""we have given you good tidings in truth so do not be of the despairing"" he said ""and who despairs of the mercy of his lord except for those astray?"" said ""then what is your business o messengers?"" they said ""indeed we have been sent to a people of criminals except the family of lot indeed we will save them all except his wife"" we decreed that she is of those who remain behind and when the messengers came to the family of lot he said ""indeed you are people unknown"" they said ""but we have come to you with that about which they were disputing and we have come to you with truth and indeed we are truthful so set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded"" and we conveyed to him of that matter that those would be eliminated by early morning and the people of the city came rejoicing said ""indeed these are my guests so do not shame me and fear allāh and do not disgrace me"" they said ""have we not forbidden you from people?"" said ""these are my daughters if you would be doers "" by your life indeed they were in their intoxication wandering blindly so the shriek seized them at sunrise and we made the highest part its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay indeed in that are signs for those who discern and indeed they are on an established road indeed in that is a sign for the believers and the companions of the thicket were wrongdoers so we took retribution from them and indeed both are on a clear highway and certainly did the companions of alḥijr deny the messengers and we gave them our signs but from them they were turning away and they used to carve from the mountains houses feeling secure but the shriek seized them at early morning so nothing availed them what they used to earn and we have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth and indeed the hour is coming so forgive with gracious forgiveness indeed your lord he is the knowing creator and we have certainly given you seven of the often repeated and the great qur’ān do not extend your eyes toward that by which we have given enjoyment to categories of them and do not grieve over them and lower your wing to the believers and say ""indeed i am the clear warner"" just as we had revealed to the separators who have made the qur’ān into portions so by your lord we will surely question them all about what they used to do then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists indeed we are sufficient for you against the mockers who make with allāh another deity but they are going to know and we already know that your breast is constrained by what they say so exalt with praise of your lord and be of those who prostrate and worship your lord until there comes to you the certainty"
16,27.674418604651162,3570,129,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful the command of allāh is coming so be not impatient for it exalted is he and high above what they associate with him he sends down the angels with the inspiration of his command upon whom he wills of his servants ""warn that there is no deity except me so fear me"" he created the heavens and earth in truth high is he above what they associate with him he created man from a spermdrop then at once he is a clear adversary and the grazing livestock he has created for you in them is warmth and benefits and from them you eat and for you in them is beauty when you bring them in and when you send them out and they carry your loads to a land you could not have reached except with difficulty to yourselves indeed your lord is kind and merciful and the horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and adornment and he creates that which you do not know and upon allāh is the direction of the way and among them are those deviating and if he willed he could have guided you all it is he who sends down rain from the sky from it is drink and from it is foliage in which you pasture he causes to grow for you thereby the crops olives palm trees grapevines and of all the fruits indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought and he has subjected for you the night and day and the sun and moon and the stars are subjected by his command indeed in that are signs for a people who reason and whatever he multiplied for you on the earth of varying colors indeed in that is a sign for a people who remember and it is he who subjected the sea for you to eat from it tender meat and to extract from it ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowing through it and that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful and he has cast into the earth firmly set mountains lest it shift with you and rivers and roads that you may be guided and landmarks and by the stars they are guided then is he who creates like one who does not create? so will you not be reminded? and if you should count the favors of allāh you could not enumerate them indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful and allāh knows what you conceal and what you declare and those they invoke other than allāh create nothing and they are created they are dead not alive and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected your god is one god but those who do not believe in the hereafter their hearts are disapproving and they are arrogant assuredly allāh knows what they conceal and what they declare indeed he does not like the arrogant and when it is said to them ""what has your lord sent down?"" they say ""legends of the former peoples"" that they may bear their own burdens in full on the day of resurrection and some of the burdens of those whom they misguide without knowledge unquestionably evil is that which they bear those before them had already plotted but allāh came at their building from the foundations so the roof fell upon them from above them and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and say ""where are my 'partners' for whom you used to oppose ?"" those who were given knowledge will say ""indeed disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers"" the ones whom the angels take in death wronging themselves and then offer submission ""we were not doing any evil"" but yes! indeed allāh is knowing of what you used to do so enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and how wretched is the residence of the arrogant and it will be said to those who feared allāh ""what did your lord send down?"" they will say "" good"" for those who do good in this world is good and the home of the hereafter is better and how excellent is the home of the righteous gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter beneath which rivers flow they will have therein whatever they wish thus does allāh reward the righteous the ones whom the angels take in death good and pure will say ""peace be upon you enter paradise for what you used to do"" do they await except that the angels should come to them or there comes the command of your lord? thus did those do before them and allāh wronged them not but they had been wronging themselves so they were struck by the evil consequences of what they did and were enveloped by what they used to ridicule and those who associate others with allāh say ""if allāh had willed we would not have worshipped anything other than him neither we nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden anything through other than him"" thus did those do before them so is there upon the messengers except clear notification? and we certainly sent into every nation a messenger ""worship allāh and avoid ṭāghūt"" and among them were those whom allāh guided and among them were those upon whom error was decreed so proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers if you should strive for their guidance indeed allāh does not guide those he sends astray and they will have no helpers and they swear by allāh their strongest oaths allāh will not resurrect one who dies but yes  a true promise upon him but most of the people do not know so he will make clear to them that wherein they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that they were liars indeed our word to a thing when we intend it is but that we say to it ""be"" and it is and those who emigrated for allāh after they had been wronged we will surely settle them in this world in a good place but the reward of the hereafter is greater if only they could know those who endured patiently and upon their lord relied and we sent not before you except men to whom we revealed so ask the people of the message if you do not know with clear proofs and written ordinances and we revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought then do those who have planned evil deeds feel secure that allāh will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive? or that he would not seize them during their activity and they could not cause failure ? or that he would not seize them gradually ? but indeed your lord is kind and merciful have they not considered what things allāh has created? their shadows incline to the right and to the left prostrating to allāh while they are humble and to allāh prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of creatures and the angels and they are not arrogant they fear their lord above them and they do what they are commanded and allāh has said ""do not take for yourselves two deities he is but one god so fear only me"" and to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth and to him is worship constantly then is it other than allāh that you fear? and whatever you have of favor it is from allāh then when adversity touches you to him you cry for help then when he removes the adversity from you at once a party of you associates others with their lord so they will deny what we have given them then enjoy yourselves for you are going to know and they assign to what they do not know a portion of that which we have provided them by allāh you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent and they attribute to allāh daughters exalted is he and for them is what they desire and when one of them is informed of a female his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief he hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground? unquestionably evil is what they decide for those who do not believe in the hereafter is the description of evil and for allāh is the highest attribute and he is exalted in might the wise and if allāh were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing he would not have left upon it any creature but he defers them for a specified term and when their term has come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede and they attribute to allāh that which they dislike and their tongues assert the lie that they will have the best assuredly they will have the fire and they will be neglected by allāh we did certainly send to nations before you but satan made their deeds attractive to them and he is their ally today and they will have a painful punishment and we have not revealed to you the book except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe and allāh has sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen and indeed for you in grazing livestock is a lesson we give you drink from what is in their bellies between excretion and blood pure milk palatable to drinkers and from the fruits of the palm trees and grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision indeed in that is a sign for a people who reason and your lord inspired to the bee ""take for yourself among the mountains houses and among the trees and that which they construct then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your lord laid down "" there emerges from their bellies a drink varying in colors in which there is healing for people indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought and allāh created you then he will take you in death and among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit age so that he will not know after knowledge a thing indeed allāh is knowing and competent and allāh has favored some of you over others in provision but those who were favored would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess so they would be equal to them therein then is it the favor of allāh they reject? and allāh has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of allāh they disbelieve? and they worship besides allāh that which does not possess for them provision from the heavens and the earth at all and they are unable so do not assert similarities to allāh indeed allāh knows and you do not know allāh presents an example a slave owned and unable to do a thing and he to whom we have provided from us good provision so he spends from it secretly and publicly can they be equal? praise to allāh! but most of them do not know and allāh presents an example of two men one of them dumb and unable to do a thing while he is a burden to his guardian wherever he directs him he brings no good is he equal to one who commands justice while he is on a straight path? and to allāh belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth and the command for the hour is not but as a glance of the eye or even nearer indeed allāh is over all things competent and allāh has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers not knowing a thing and he made for you hearing and vision and hearts that perhaps you would be grateful do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky? none holds them up except allāh indeed in that are signs for a people who believe and allāh has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment and from their wool fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a time and allāh has made for you from that which he has created shadows and has made for you from the mountains shelters and has made for you garments which protect you from the heat and garments which protect you from your battle thus does he complete his favor upon you that you might submit but if they turn away  then only upon you is clear notification they recognize the favor of allāh then they deny it and most of them are disbelievers and the day when we will resurrect from every nation a witness then it will not be permitted to the disbelievers nor will they be asked to appease and when those who wronged see the punishment it will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved and when those who associated others with allāh see their ""partners"" they will say ""our lord these are our partners whom we used to invoke besides you"" but they will throw at them the statement ""indeed you are liars"" and they will impart to allāh that day submission and lost from them is what they used to invent those who disbelieved and averted from the way of allāh we will increase them in punishment over punishment for what corruption they were causing and the day when we will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves and we will bring you as a witness over these and we have sent down to you the book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the muslims indeed allāh orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression he admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded and fulfill the covenant of allāh when you have taken it and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made allāh over you a security indeed allāh knows what you do and do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong taking your oaths as deceit between you because one community is more plentiful than another community allāh only tries you thereby and he will surely make clear to you on the day of resurrection that over which you used to differ and if allāh had willed he could have made you one religion but he sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do and do not take your oaths as deceit between you lest a foot slip after it was firm and you would taste evil for what you diverted from the way of allāh and you would have a great punishment and do not exchange the covenant of allāh for a small price indeed what is with allāh is best for you if only you could know whatever you have will end but what allāh has is lasting and we will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he is a believer we will surely cause him to live a good life and we will surely give them their reward according to the best of what they used to do so when you recite the qur’ān seek refuge in allāh from satan the expelled indeed there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their lord his authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with allāh and when we substitute a verse in place of a verse and allāh is most knowing of what he sends down they say ""you are but an inventor "" but most of them do not know say ""the pure spirit has brought it down from your lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the muslims"" and we certainly know that they say ""it is only a human being who teaches him "" the tongue of the one they refer to is foreign and this is a clear arabic language indeed those who do not believe in the verses of allāh allāh will not guide them and for them is a painful punishment they only invent falsehood who do not believe in the verses of allāh and it is those who are the liars whoever disbelieves in allāh after his belief except for one who is forced while his heart is secure in faith but those who open their breasts to disbelief upon them is wrath from allāh and for them is a great punishment that is because they preferred the worldly life over the hereafter and that allāh does not guide the disbelieving people those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision allāh has sealed and it is those who are the heedless assuredly it is they in the hereafter who will be the losers then indeed your lord to those who emigrated after they had been compelled and thereafter fought and were patient indeed your lord after that is forgiving and merciful on the day when every soul will come disputing for itself and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did and they will not be wronged and allāh presents an example a city which was safe and secure its provision coming to it in abundance from every location but it denied the favors of allāh so allāh made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what they had been doing and there had certainly come to them a messenger from among themselves but they denied him so punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers then eat of what allāh has provided for you lawful and good and be grateful for the favor of allāh if it is him that you worship he has only forbidden to you dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allāh but whoever is forced neither desiring nor transgressing  then indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful and do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth ""this is lawful and this is unlawful"" to invent falsehood about allāh indeed those who invent falsehood about allāh will not succeed a brief enjoyment and they will have a painful punishment and to those who are jews we have prohibited that which we related to you before and we did not wrong them but they were wronging themselves then indeed your lord to those who have done wrong out of ignorance and then repent after that and correct themselves indeed your lord thereafter is forgiving and merciful indeed abraham was a leader devoutly obedient to allāh inclining toward truth and he was not of those who associate others with allāh grateful for his favors he chose him and guided him to a straight path and we gave him good in this world and indeed in the hereafter he will be among the righteous then we revealed to you to follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of those who associate with allāh the sabbath was only appointed for those who differed over it and indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ invite to the way of your lord with wisdom and good instruction and argue with them in a way that is best indeed your lord is most knowing of who has strayed from his way and he is most knowing of who is guided and if you punish punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed but if you are patient it is better for those who are patient and be patient and your patience is not but through allāh and do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire indeed allāh is with those who fear him and those who are doers of good"
17,26.821428571428573,3004,112,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful exalted is he who took his servant by night from almasjid alḥarām to almasjid alaqṣā whose surroundings we have blessed to show him of our signs indeed he is the hearing the seeing and we gave moses the scripture and made it a guidance for the children of israel that you not take other than me as disposer of affairs o descendants of those we carried with noah indeed he was a grateful servant and we conveyed to the children of israel in the scripture that ""you will surely cause corruption on the earth twice and you will surely reach great haughtiness"" so when the promise came for the first of them we sent against you servants of ours those of great military might and they probed into the homes and it was a promise fulfilled then we gave back to you a return victory over them and we reinforced you with wealth and sons and made you more numerous in manpower ""if you do good you do good for yourselves and if you do evil to them "" then when the final promise came to sadden your faces and to enter the masjid as they entered it the first time and to destroy what they had taken over with destruction ""it is expected that your lord will have mercy upon you but if you return we will return and we have made hell for the disbelievers a prisonbed"" indeed this qur’ān guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward and that those who do not believe in the hereafter we have prepared for them a painful punishment and man supplicates for evil as he supplicates for good and man is ever hasty and we have made the night and day two signs and we erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible that you may seek bounty from your lord and may know the number of years and the account and everything we have set out in detail and every person we have imposed his fate upon his neck and we will produce for him on the day of resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open ""read your record sufficient is yourself against you this day as accountant"" whoever is guided is only guided for his soul and whoever errs only errs against it and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another and never would we punish until we sent a messenger and when we intend to destroy a city we command its affluent but they defiantly disobey therein so the word comes into effect upon it and we destroy it with destruction and how many have we destroyed from the generations after noah and sufficient is your lord concerning the sins of his servants as aware and seeing whoever should desire the immediate we hasten for him from it what we will to whom we intend then we have made for him hell which he will burn censured and banished but whoever desires the hereafter and exerts the effort due to it while he is a believer it is those whose effort is ever appreciated to each we extend to these and to those from the gift of your lord and never has the gift of your lord been restricted look how we have favored some of them over others but the hereafter is greater in degrees and greater in distinction do not make with allāh another deity and become censured and forsaken and your lord has decreed that you worship not except him and to parents good treatment whether one or both of them reach old age with you say not to them ""uff"" and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word and lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say ""my lord have mercy upon them as they brought me up small"" your lord is most knowing of what is within yourselves if you should be righteous  then indeed he is ever to the often returning forgiving and give the relative his right and the poor and the traveler and do not spend wastefully indeed the wasteful are brothers of the devils and ever has satan been to his lord ungrateful and if you turn away from them awaiting mercy from your lord which you expect then speak to them a gentle word and do not make your hand chained to your neck or extend it completely and become blamed and insolvent indeed your lord extends provision for whom he wills and restricts indeed he is ever concerning his servants aware and seeing and do not kill your children for fear of poverty we provide for them and for you indeed their killing is ever a great sin and do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse indeed it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way and do not kill the soul which allāh has forbidden except by right and whoever is killed unjustly we have given his heir authority but let him not exceed limits in taking life indeed he has been supported and do not approach the property of an orphan except in the way that is best until he reaches maturity and fulfill commitment indeed the commitment is ever questioned and give full measure when you measure and weigh with an even balance that is the best and best in result and do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge indeed the hearing the sight and the heart about all those will be questioned and do not walk upon the earth exultantly indeed you will never tear the earth and you will never reach the mountains in height all that  its evil is ever in the sight of your lord detested that is from what your lord has revealed to you of wisdom and do not make with allāh another deity lest you be thrown into hell blamed and banished then has your lord chosen you for sons and taken from among the angels daughters? indeed you say a grave saying and we have certainly diversified in this qur’ān that they may be reminded but it does not increase them except in aversion say ""if there had been with him gods as they say then they would have sought to the owner of the throne a way"" exalted is he and high above what they say by great sublimity the seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt him and there is not a thing except that it exalts by his praise but you do not understand their exalting indeed he is ever forbearing and forgiving and when you recite the qur’ān we put between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a concealed partition and we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and when you mention your lord alone in the qur’ān they turn back in aversion we are most knowing of how they listen to it when they listen to you and when they are in private conversation when the wrongdoers say ""you follow not but a man affected by magic"" look how they strike for you comparisons but they have strayed so they cannot a way and they say ""when we are bones and crumbled particles will we be resurrected as a new creation?"" say ""be you stones or iron or creation of that which is great within your breasts"" and they will say ""who will restore us?"" say ""he who brought you forth the first time"" then they will nod their heads toward you and say ""when is that?"" say ""perhaps it will be soon on the day he will call you and you will respond with praise of him and think that you had not remained except for a little"" and tell my servants to say that which is best indeed satan induces among them indeed satan is ever to mankind a clear enemy your lord is most knowing of you if he wills he will have mercy upon you or if he wills he will punish you and we have not sent you over them as a manager and your lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth and we have made some of the prophets exceed others and to david we gave the book say ""invoke those you have claimed besides him for they do not possess the removal of adversity from you or transfer "" those whom they invoke seek means of access to their lord which of them would be nearest and they hope for his mercy and fear his punishment indeed the punishment of your lord is ever feared and there is no city but that we will destroy it before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment that has ever been in the register inscribed and nothing has prevented us from sending signs except that the former peoples denied them and we gave thamūd the shecamel as a visible sign but they wronged her and we send not the signs except as a warning and when we told you ""indeed your lord has encompassed the people"" and we did not make the sight which we showed you except as a trial for the people as was the accursed tree in the qur’ān and we threaten them but it increases them not except in great transgression and when we said to the angels ""prostrate to adam"" and they prostrated except for iblees he said ""should i prostrate to one you created from clay?"" said ""do you see this one whom you have honored above me? if you delay me until the day of resurrection i will surely destroy his descendants except for a few"" said ""go for whoever of them follows you indeed hell will be the recompense of you an ample recompense and incite whoever you can among them with your voice and assault them with your horses and foot soldiers and become a partner in their wealth and their children and promise them"" but satan does not promise them except delusion indeed over my servants there is for you no authority and sufficient is your lord as disposer of affairs it is your lord who drives the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of his bounty indeed he is ever to you merciful and when adversity touches you at sea lost are those you invoke except for him but when he delivers you to the land you turn away and ever is man ungrateful then do you feel secure that he will not cause a part of the land to swallow you or send against you a storm of stones? then you would not find for yourselves an advocate or do you feel secure that he will not send you back into it another time and send upon you a hurricane of wind and drown you for what you denied? then you would not find for yourselves against us an avenger and we have certainly honored the children of adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what we have created with preference the day we will call forth every people with their record then whoever is given his record in his right hand those will read their records and injustice will not be done to them as much as a thread and whoever is blind in this will be blind in the hereafter and more astray in way and indeed they were about to tempt you away from that which we revealed to you in order to you invent about us something else and then they would have taken you as a friend and if we had not strengthened you you would have almost inclined to them a little then we would have made you taste double life and double death then you would not find for yourself against us a helper and indeed they were about to provoke you from the land to evict you therefrom and then they will not remain after you except for a little established way for those we had sent before you of our messengers and you will not find in our way any alteration establish prayer at the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and the qur’ān of dawn indeed the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed and from the night pray with it as additional for you it is expected that your lord will resurrect you to a praised station and say ""my lord cause me to enter a sound entrance and to exit a sound exit and grant me from yourself a supporting authority"" and say ""truth has come and falsehood has departed indeed is falsehood ever bound to depart"" and we send down of the qur’ān that which is healing and mercy for the believers but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss and when we bestow favor upon man he turns away and distances himself and when evil touches him he is ever despairing say ""each works according to his manner but your lord is most knowing of who is best guided in way"" and they ask you about the soul say ""the soul is of the affair of my lord and you have not been given of knowledge except a little"" and if we willed we could surely do away with that which we revealed to you then you would not find for yourself concerning it an advocate against us except as a mercy from your lord indeed his favor upon you has ever been great say ""if mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this qur’ān they could not produce the like of it even if they were to each other assistants"" and we have certainly diversified for the people in this qur’ān from every example but most of the people refused except disbelief and they say ""we will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring or you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force or you make the heaven fall upon us in fragments as you have claimed or you bring allāh and the angels before or you have a house of ornament or you ascend into the sky and we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read"" say ""exalted is my lord! was i ever but a human messenger?"" and what prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said ""has allāh sent a human messenger?"" say ""if there were upon the earth angels walking securely we would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel messenger"" say ""sufficient is allāh as witness between me and you indeed he is ever concerning his servants aware and seeing"" and whoever allāh guides he is the guided and whoever he sends astray you will never find for them protectors besides him and we will gather them on the day of resurrection on their faces blind dumb and deaf their refuge is hell every time it subsides we increase them blazing fire that is their recompense because they disbelieved in our verses and said ""when we are bones and crumbled particles will we be resurrected a new creation?"" do they not see that allāh who created the heavens and earth is able to create the likes of them? and he has appointed for them a term about which there is no doubt but the wrongdoers refuse except disbelief say ""if you possessed the depositories of the mercy of my lord then you would withhold out of fear of spending"" and ever has man been stingy and we had certainly given moses nine evident signs so ask the children of israel when he came to them and pharaoh said to him ""indeed i think o moses that you are affected by magic"" said ""you have already known that none has sent down these except the lord of the heavens and the earth as evidence and indeed i think o pharaoh that you are destroyed"" so he intended to drive them from the land but we drowned him and those with him all together and we said after him to the children of israel ""dwell in the land and when there comes the promise of the hereafter we will bring you forth in gathering"" and with the truth we have sent it down and with the truth it has descended and we have not sent you except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner and a qur’ān which we have separated that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period and we have sent it down progressively say ""believe in it or do not believe"" indeed those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them they fall upon their faces in prostration and they say ""exalted is our lord! indeed the promise of our lord has been fulfilled"" and they fall upon their faces weeping and it increases them in humble submission say ""call upon allāh or call upon the most merciful whichever you call to him belong the best names"" and do not recite loudly in your prayer or quietly but seek between that an way and say ""praise to allāh who has not taken a son and has had no partner in dominion and has no protector out of weakness and glorify him with glorification"""
18,28.74774774774775,3191,111,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful praise is to allāh who has sent down upon his servant the book and has not made therein any deviance straight to warn of severe punishment from him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward in which they will remain forever and to warn those who say ""allāh has taken a son"" they have no knowledge of it nor had their fathers grave is the word that comes out of their mouths they speak not except a lie then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them if they do not believe in this message out of sorrow indeed we have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that we may test them which of them is best in deed and indeed we will make that which is upon it a barren ground or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were among our signs a wonder? when the youths retreated to the cave and said ""our lord grant us from yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance"" so we cast over their ears within the cave for a number of years then we awakened them that we might show which of the two factions was most precise in calculating what they had remained in time it is we who relate to you their story in truth indeed they were youths who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance and we bound their hearts when they stood up and said ""our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth never will we invoke besides him any deity we would have certainly spoken then an excessive transgression these our people have taken besides him deities why do they not bring for them a clear evidence? and who is more unjust than one who invents about allāh a lie?"" ""and when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than allāh retreat to the cave your lord will spread out for you of his mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility"" and you would see the sun when it rose inclining away from their cave on the right and when it set passing away from them on the left while they were within an open space thereof that was from the signs of allāh he whom allāh guides is the guided but he whom he sends astray never will you find for him a protecting guide and you would think them awake while they were asleep and we turned them to the right and to the left while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance if you had looked at them you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror and similarly we awakened them that they might question one another said a speaker from among them ""how long have you remained ?"" they said ""we have remained a day or part of a day"" they said ""your lord is most knowing of how long you remained so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious and let no one be aware of you indeed if they come to know of you they will stone you or return you to their religion and never would you succeed then ever"" and similarly we caused them to be found that they would know that the promise of allāh is truth and that of the hour there is no doubt when they disputed among themselves about their affair and said ""construct over them a structure their lord is most knowing about them"" said those who prevailed in the matter ""we will surely take over them a masjid"" they will say there were three the fourth of them being their dog and they will say there were five the sixth of them being their dog guessing at the unseen and they will say there were seven and the eighth of them was their dog say ""my lord is most knowing of their number none knows them except a few so do not argue about them except with an obvious argument and do not inquire about them among from anyone"" and never say of anything ""indeed i will do that tomorrow"" except ""if allāh wills"" and remember your lord when you forget and say ""perhaps my lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct"" and they remained in their cave for three hundred years and exceeded by nine say ""allāh is most knowing of how long they remained he has the unseen of the heavens and the earth how seeing is he and how hearing! they have not besides him any protector and he shares not his legislation with anyone"" and recite what has been revealed to you of the book of your lord there is no changer of his words and never will you find in other than him a refuge and keep yourself patient with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his face and let not your eyes pass beyond them desiring adornments of the worldly life and do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever neglect and say ""the truth is from your lord so whoever wills let him believe and whoever wills let him disbelieve"" indeed we have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them and if they call for relief they will be relieved with water like murky oil which scalds faces wretched is the drink and evil is the resting place indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds those will have gardens of perpetual residence beneath them rivers will flow they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade reclining therein on adorned couches excellent is the reward and good is the resting place and present to them an example of two men we granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines and we bordered them with palm trees and placed between them crops each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything and we caused to gush forth within them a river and he had fruit so he said to his companion while he was conversing with him ""i am greater than you in wealth and mightier in men"" and he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself he said ""i do not think that this will perish ever and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be brought back to my lord i will surely find better than this as a return"" his companion said to him while he was conversing with him ""have you disbelieved in he who created you from dust and then from a spermdrop and then proportioned you a man? but as for me he is allāh my lord and i do not associate with my lord anyone and why did you when you entered your garden not say 'what allāh willed there is no power except in allāh'? although you see me less than you in wealth and children it may be that my lord will give me better than your garden and will send upon it a penalty from the sky and it will become a smooth dusty ground or its water will become sunken so you would never be able to seek it"" and his fruits were encompassed so he began to turn his hands about over what he had spent on it while it had collapsed upon its trellises and said ""oh i wish i had not associated with my lord anyone"" and there was for him no company to aid him other than allāh nor could he defend himself there the authority is for allāh the truth he is best in reward and best in outcome and present to them the example of the life of this world like rain which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and it becomes dry remnants scattered by the winds and allāh is ever over all things perfect in ability wealth and children are adornment of the worldly life but the enduring good deeds are better to your lord for reward and better for hope and the day when we will remove the mountains and you will see the earth exposed and we will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone and they will be presented before your lord in rows ""you have certainly come to us just as we created you the first time but you claimed that we would never make for you an appointment"" and the record will be placed and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it and they will say ""oh woe to us! what is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it?"" and they will find what they did present and your lord does injustice to no one and when we said to the angels ""prostrate to adam"" and they prostrated except for iblees he was of the jinn and departed from the command of his lord then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than me while they are enemies to you? wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange i did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves and i would not have taken the misguiders as assistants and the day when he will say ""call my 'partners' whom you claimed"" and they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and we will put between them destruction and the criminals will see the fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein and they will not find from it a way elsewhere and we have certainly diversified in this qur’ān for the people from every example but man has ever been most of anything dispute and nothing has prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that there befall them the precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment should come before them and we send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners and those who disbelieve dispute by falsehood to invalidate thereby the truth and have taken my verses and that of which they are warned in ridicule and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth? indeed we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and if you invite them to guidance they will never be guided then ever and your lord is the forgiving the possessor of mercy if he were to impose blame upon them for what they earned he would have hastened for them the punishment rather for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape and those cities we destroyed them when they wronged and we made for their destruction an appointed time and when moses said to his boy ""i will not cease until i reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period"" but when they reached the junction between them they forgot their fish and it took its course into the sea slipping away so when they had passed beyond it said to his boy ""bring us our morning meal we have certainly suffered in this our journey fatigue"" he said ""did you see when we retired to the rock? indeed i forgot the fish and none made me forget it except satan that i should mention it and it took its course into the sea amazingly"" said ""that is what we were seeking"" so they returned following their footprints and they found a servant from among our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from us a knowledge moses said to him ""may i follow you on that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement?"" he said ""indeed with me you will never be able to have patience and how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?"" said ""you will find me if allāh wills patient and i will not disobey you in order"" he said ""then if you follow me do not ask me about anything until i make to you about it mention "" so they set out until when they had embarked on the ship he tore it open said ""have you torn it open to drown its people? you have certainly done a grave thing"" said ""did i not say that with me you would never be able to have patience?"" said ""do not blame me for what i forgot and do not overwhelm me in my matter with difficulty"" so they set out until when they met a boy he killed him said ""have you killed a pure soul for other than a soul? you have certainly done a deplorable thing"" said ""did i not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience?"" said ""if i should ask you about anything after this then do not keep me as a companion you have obtained from me an excuse"" so they set out until when they came to the people of a town they asked its people for food but they refused to offer them hospitality and they found therein a wall about to collapse so he restored it said ""if you wished you could have taken for it a payment"" said ""this is parting between me and you i will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience as for the ship it belonged to poor people working at sea so i intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every ship by force and as for the boy his parents were believers and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief so we intended that their lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy and as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a treasure for them and their father had been righteous so your lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure as a mercy from your lord and i did it not of my own accord that is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience"" and they ask you about dhulqarnayn say ""i will recite to you about him a report"" indeed we established him upon the earth and we gave him from everything a way so he followed a way until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it setting in a body of dark water and he found near it a people we said ""o dhulqarnayn either you punish or else adopt among them goodness"" he said ""as for one who wrongs we will punish him then he will be returned to his lord and he will punish him with a terrible punishment but as for one who believes and does righteousness he will have a reward of the best and we will speak to him from our command with ease"" then he followed a way until when he came to the rising of the sun he found it rising on a people for whom we had not made against it any shield thus and we had encompassed that he had in knowledge then he followed a way until when he reached between two mountains he found beside them a people who could hardly understand speech they said ""o dhulqarnayn indeed gog and magog are corrupters in the land so may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between us and them a barrier?"" he said ""that in which my lord has established me is better but assist me with strength i will make between you and them a dam bring me bars of iron"" until when he had leveled between the two mountain walls he said ""blow "" until when he had made it fire he said ""bring me that i may pour over it molten copper"" so they were unable to pass over it nor were they able in it any penetration said ""this is a mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord comes he will make it level and ever is the promise of my lord true"" and we will leave them that day surging over each other and the horn will be blown and we will assemble them in assembly and we will present hell that day to the disbelievers on display those whose eyes had been within a cover from my remembrance and they were not able to hear then do those who disbelieve think that they can take my servants instead of me as allies? indeed we have prepared hell for the disbelievers as a lodging say ""shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to deeds? those whose effort is lost in worldly life while they think that they are doing well in work"" those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their lord and in meeting him so their deeds have become worthless and we will not assign to them on the day of resurrection any weight that is their recompense hell for what they denied and they took my signs and my messengers in ridicule indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds they will have the gardens of paradise as a lodging wherein they abide eternally they will not desire from it any transfer say ""if the sea were ink for the words of my lord the sea would be exhausted before the words of my lord were exhausted even if we brought the like of it in supplement"" say ""i am only a man like you to whom has been revealed that your god is one god so whoever would hope for the meeting with his lord let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his lord anyone"""

o my father indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you so follow me i will guide you to an even path o my father do not worship satan indeed satan has ever been to the most merciful disobedient o my father indeed i fear that there will touch you a punishment from the most merciful so you would be to satan a companion "" said ""have you no desire for my gods o abraham?

so by your lord we will surely gather them and the devils then we will bring them to be present around hell upon their knees then we will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the most merciful in insolence then surely it is we who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein and there is none of you except he will come to it this is upon your lord an inevitability decreed then we will save those who feared allāh and leave the wrongdoers within it on their knees and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who disbelieve say to those who believe ""which of two parties is best in position and best in association?"" and how many a generation have we destroyed before them who were better in possessions and appearance? say ""whoever is in error let the most merciful extend for him an extension until when they see that which they were promised either punishment or the hour  they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers"" and allāh increases those who were guided in guidance and the enduring good deeds are better to your lord for reward and better for recourse then have you seen he who disbelieved in our verses and said ""i will surely be given wealth and children ""? has he looked into the unseen or has he taken from the most merciful a promise? no! we will record what he says and extend for him from the punishment extensively and we will inherit him what he mentions and he will come to us alone and they have taken besides allāh deities that they would be for them honor no! they will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents do you not see that we have sent the devils upon the disbelievers inciting them with incitement? so be not impatient over them we only count out to them a number on the day we will gather the righteous to the most merciful as a delegation and will drive the criminals to hell in thirst none will have intercession except he who had taken from the most merciful a covenant and they say ""the most merciful has taken a son"" you have done an atrocious thing the heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation that they attribute to the most merciful a son and it is not appropriate for the most merciful that he should take a son there is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the most merciful as a servant he has enumerated them and counted them a counting and all of them are coming to him on the day of resurrection alone indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds the most merciful will appoint for them affection so we have only made it easy in your tongue that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a hostile people and how many have we destroyed before them of generations? do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound?"

when he saw a fire and said to his family ""stay here indeed i have perceived a fire perhaps i can bring you a torch or find at the fire some guidance"" and when he came to it he was called ""o moses indeed i am your lord so remove your sandals indeed you are in the blessed valley of ṭuwā and i have chosen you so listen to what is revealed indeed i am allāh there is no deity except me so worship me and establish prayer for my remembrance indeed the hour is coming i almost conceal it so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives so do not let one avert you from it who does not believe in it and follows his desire for you would perish and what is that in your right hand o moses?"" he said ""it is my staff i lean upon it and i bring down leaves for my sheep and i have therein other uses"" said ""throw it down o moses"" so he threw it down and thereupon it was a snake moving swiftly said ""seize it and fear not we will return it to its former condition and draw in your hand to your side it will come out white without disease another sign that we may show you of our greater signs go to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed "" said ""my lord expand for me my breast and ease for me my task and untie the knot from my tongue that they may understand my speech and appoint for me a minister from my family aaron my brother increase through him my strength and let him share my task that we may exalt you much and remember you much indeed you are of us ever seeing"" said ""you have been granted your request o moses and we had already conferred favor upon you another time when we inspired to your mother what we inspired 'cast him into the chest and cast it into the river and the river will throw it onto the bank there will take him an enemy to me and an enemy to him' and i bestowed upon you love from me that you would be brought up under my eye when your sister went and said 'shall i direct you to someone who will be responsible for him?' so we restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve and you killed someone but we saved you from retaliation and tried you with a trial and you remained years among the people of madyan then you came at the decreed time o moses and i produced you for myself go you and your brother with my signs and do not slacken in my remembrance go both of you to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed and speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear "" they said ""our lord indeed we are afraid that he will hasten against us or that he will transgress"" said ""fear not indeed i am with you both i hear and i see so go to him and say 'indeed we are messengers of your lord so send with us the children of israel and do not torment them we have come to you with a sign from your lord and peace will be upon he who follows the guidance indeed it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away'"" said ""so who is the lord of you two o moses?"" he said ""our lord is he who gave each thing its form and then guided "" said ""then what is the case of the former generations?"" said ""the knowledge thereof is with my lord in a record my lord neither errs nor forgets"" who has made for you the earth as a bed and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky rain and produced thereby categories of various plants eat and pasture your livestock indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence from it we created you and into it we will return you and from it we will extract you another time and we certainly showed him our signs all of them but he denied and refused he said ""have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic o moses? then we will surely bring you magic like it so make between us and you an appointment which we will not fail to keep and neither will you in a place assigned"" said ""your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at midmorning"" so pharaoh went away put together his plan and then came moses said to them ""woe to you! do not invent a lie against allāh or he will exterminate you with a punishment and he has failed who invents "" so they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation they said ""indeed these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way so resolve upon your plan and then come in line and he has succeeded today who overcomes"" they said ""o moses either you throw or we will be the first to throw"" he said ""rather you throw"" and suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving and he sensed within himself apprehension did moses we said ""fear not indeed it is you who are superior and throw what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have crafted what they have crafted is but the trick of a magician and the magician will not succeed wherever he is"" so the magicians fell down in prostration they said ""we have believed in the lord of aaron and moses"" said ""you believed him before i gave you permission indeed he is your leader who has taught you magic so i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees and you will surely know which of us is more severe in punishment and more enduring"" they said ""never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and he who created us so decree whatever you are to decree you can only decree for this worldly life indeed we have believed in our lord that he may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us of magic and allāh is better and more enduring"" indeed whoever comes to his lord as a criminal indeed for him is hell he will neither die therein nor live but whoever comes to him as a believer having done righteous deeds for those will be the highest degrees gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and that is the reward of one who purifies himself and we had inspired to moses ""travel by night with my servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea you will not fear being overtaken nor be afraid "" so pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers and there covered them from the sea that which covered them and pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide o children of israel we delivered you from your enemy and we made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount and we sent down to you manna and quails ""eat from the good things with which we have provided you and do not transgress therein lest my anger should descend upon you and he upon whom my anger descends has certainly fallen "" but indeed i am the perpetual forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance ""and what made you hasten from your people o moses?"" he said ""they are close upon my tracks and i hastened to you my lord that you be pleased"" said ""but indeed we have tried your people after you and the sāmirī has led them astray"" so moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said ""o my people did your lord not make you a good promise? then was the time too long for you or did you wish that wrath from your lord descend upon you so you broke your promise to me?"" they said ""we did not break our promise to you by our will but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people so we threw them and thus did the sāmirī throw"" and he extracted for them a calf which had a lowing sound and they said ""this is your god and the god of moses but he forgot"" did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit? and aaron had already told them before ""o my people you are only being tested by it and indeed your lord is the most merciful so follow me and obey my order"" they said ""we will never cease being devoted to it until moses returns to us"" said ""o aaron what prevented you when you saw them going astray from following me? then have you disobeyed my order?"" said ""o son of my mother do not seize by my beard or by my head indeed i feared that you would say 'you caused division among the children of israel and you did not observe my word'"" said ""and what is your case o sāmirī?"" he said ""i saw what they did not see so i took a handful from the track of the messenger and threw it and thus did my soul entice me"" said ""then go and indeed it is for you in life to say 'no contact' and indeed you have an appointment you will not fail to keep and look at your 'god' to which you remained devoted we will surely burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast your god is only allāh except for whom there is no deity he has encompassed all things in knowledge"" thus we relate to you from the news of what has preceded and we have certainly given you from us a message whoever turns away from it then indeed he will bear on the day of resurrection a burden eternally therein and evil it is for them on the day of resurrection as a load the day the horn will be blown and we will gather the criminals that day blueeyed they will murmur among themselves ""you remained not but ten "" we are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner will say ""you remained not but one day"" and they ask you about the mountains so say ""my lord will blow them away with a blast and he will leave it a level plain you will not see therein a depression or an elevation"" that day they will follow the caller no deviation therefrom and voices will be stilled before the most merciful so you will not hear except a whisper that day no intercession will benefit except one to whom the most merciful has given permission and has accepted his word he knows what is before them and what will be after them but they do not encompass it in knowledge and faces will be humbled before the everliving the selfsustaining and he will have failed who carries injustice but he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation and thus we have sent it down as an arabic qur’ān and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid or it would cause them remembrance so high is allāh the sovereign the truth and do not hasten with the qur’ān before its revelation is completed to you and say ""my lord increase me in knowledge"" and we had already taken a promise from adam before but he forgot and we found not in him determination and when we said to the angels ""prostrate to adam"" and they prostrated except iblees he refused so we said ""o adam indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife then let him not remove you from paradise so you would suffer indeed it is for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed and indeed you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun"" then satan whispered to him he said ""o adam shall i direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"" and they ate of it and their private parts became apparent to them and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaves of paradise and adam disobeyed his lord and erred then his lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided said ""descend from it  all being enemies to one another and if there should come to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance will neither go astray nor suffer and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life and we will gather him on the day of resurrection blind"" he will say ""my lord why have you raised me blind while i was seeing?"" will say ""thus did our signs come to you and you forgot them and thus will you this day be forgotten"" and thus do we recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his lord and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and more enduring then has it not become clear to them how many generations we destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings? indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been an obligation and a specified term so be patient over what they say and exalt with praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting and during periods of the night and at the ends of the day that you may be satisfied and do not extend your eyes toward that by which we have given enjoyment to categories of them the splendor of worldly life by which we test them and the provision of your lord is better and more enduring and enjoin prayer upon your family and be steadfast therein we ask you not for provision we provide for you and the outcome is for righteousness and they say ""why does he not bring us a sign from his lord?"" has there not come to them evidence of what was in the former scriptures? and if we had destroyed them with a punishment before him they would have said ""our lord why did you not send to us a messenger so we could have followed your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced?"" say ""each is waiting so wait for you will know who are the companions of the sound path and who is guided"""

so would you approach magic while you are aware ?"" he said ""my lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth and he is the hearing the knowing"" but they say "" a mixture of false dreams rather he has invented it rather he is a poet so let him bring us a sign just as the previous were sent "" not a city which we destroyed believed before them so will they believe? and we sent not before you except men to whom we revealed so ask the people of the message if you do not know and we did not make them forms not eating food nor were they immortal then we fulfilled for them the promise and we saved them and whom we willed and destroyed the transgressors we have certainly sent down to you a book in which is your mention then will you not reason? and how many a city which was unjust have we shattered and produced after it another people and when they perceived our punishment at once they fled from it ""do not flee but return to where you were given luxury and to your homes perhaps you will be questioned"" they said ""o woe to us! indeed we were wrongdoers"" and that declaration of theirs did not cease until we made them a harvest extinguished and we did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play had we intended to take a diversion we could have taken it from with us if we were to do so rather we dash the truth upon falsehood and it destroys it and thereupon it departs and for you is destruction from that which you describe to him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth and those near him are not prevented by arrogance from his worship nor do they tire they exalt night and day do not slacken or have they taken for themselves gods from the earth who resurrect ? had there been within them gods besides allāh they both would have been ruined so exalted is allāh lord of the throne above what they describe he is not questioned about what he does but they will be questioned or have they taken gods besides him? say ""produce your proof this is the message for those with me and the message of those before me"" but most of them do not know the truth so they are turning away and we sent not before you any messenger except we revealed to him that ""there is no deity except me so worship me"" and they say ""the most merciful has taken a son"" exalted is he! rather they are honored servants they cannot precede him in word and they act by his command he knows what is before them and what will be after them and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom he approves and they from fear of him are apprehensive and whoever of them should say ""indeed i am a god besides him"" that one we would recompense with hell thus do we recompense the wrongdoers have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity and then we separated them and made from water every living thing? then will they not believe? and we placed within the earth firmly set mountains lest it should shift with them and we made therein passes roads that they might be guided and we made the sky a protected ceiling but they from its signs are turning away and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon all in an orbit are swimming and we did not grant to any man before you eternity so if you die would they be eternal? every soul will taste death and we test you with evil and with good as trial and to us you will be returned and when those who disbelieve see you they take you not except in ridicule ""is this the one who mentions your gods?"" and they are at the mention of the most merciful disbelievers man was created of haste i will show you my signs so do not impatiently urge me and they say ""when is this promise if you should be truthful?"" if those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not avert the fire from their faces or from their backs and they will not be aided rather it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them and they will not be able to repel it nor will they be reprieved and already were messengers ridiculed before you but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule say ""who can protect you at night or by day from the most merciful?"" but they are from the remembrance of their lord turning away or do they have gods to defend them other than us? they are unable to help themselves nor can they be protected from us but we have provided good things for these and their fathers until life was prolonged for them then do they not see that we set upon the land reducing it from its borders? is it they who will overcome? say ""i only warn you by revelation"" but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned and if a whiff of the punishment of your lord should touch them they would surely say ""o woe to us! indeed we have been wrongdoers"" and we place the scales of justice for the day of resurrection so no soul will be treated unjustly at all and if there is the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it forth and sufficient are we as accountant and we had already given moses and aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder for the righteous who fear their lord unseen while they are of the hour apprehensive and this is a blessed message which we have sent down then are you with it unacquainted? and we had certainly given abraham his sound judgement before and we were of him wellknowing when he said to his father and his people ""what are these statues to which you are devoted?"" they said ""we found our fathers worshippers of them"" he said ""you were certainly you and your fathers in manifest error"" they said ""have you come to us with truth or are you of those who jest?"" he said "" rather your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth who created them and i to that am of those who testify and by allāh i will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away"" so he made them into fragments except a large one among them that they might return to it they said ""who has done this to our gods? indeed he is of the wrongdoers"" they said ""we heard a young man mention them who is called abraham"" they said ""then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify"" they said ""have you done this to our gods o abraham?"" he said ""rather this the largest of them did it so ask them if they should speak"" so they returned to themselves and said ""indeed you are the wrongdoers"" then they reversed themselves ""you have already known that these do not speak!"" he said ""then do you worship instead of allāh that which does not benefit you at all or harm you? uff to you and to what you worship instead of allāh then will you not use reason?"" they said ""burn him and support your gods if you are to act"" we said ""o fire be coolness and safety upon abraham"" and they intended for him a plan but we made them the greatest losers and we delivered him and lot to the land which we had blessed for the worlds and we gave him isaac and jacob in addition and all we made righteous and we made them leaders guiding by our command and we inspired to them the doing of good deeds establishment of prayer and giving of zakāh and they were worshippers of us and to lot we gave judgement and knowledge and we saved him from the city that was committing wicked deeds indeed they were a people of evil defiantly disobedient and we admitted him into our mercy indeed he was of the righteous and noah when he called before so we responded to him and saved him and his family from the great affliction and we aided him from the people who denied our signs indeed they were a people of evil so we drowned them all together and david and solomon when they judged concerning the field when the sheep of a people overran it and we were witness to their judgement and we gave understanding of it to solomon and to each we gave judgement and knowledge and we subjected the mountains to exalt along with david and the birds and we were doing and we taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your battle so will you then be grateful? and to solomon the wind blowing forcefully proceeding by his command toward the land which we had blessed and we are ever of all things knowing and of the devils were those who dived for him and did work other than that and we were of them a guardian and job when he called to his lord ""indeed adversity has touched me and you are the most merciful of the merciful"" so we responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity and we gave him his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from us and a reminder for the worshippers and ishmael and idrees and dhulkifl all were of the patient and we admitted them into our mercy indeed they were of the righteous and the man of the fish when he went off in anger and thought that we would not decree upon him and he called out within the darknesses ""there is no deity except you exalted are you indeed i have been of the wrongdoers"" so we responded to him and saved him from the distress and thus do we save the believers and zechariah when he called to his lord ""my lord do not leave me alone while you are the best of inheritors"" so we responded to him and we gave to him john and amended for him his wife indeed they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate us in hope and fear and they were to us humbly submissive and the one who guarded her chastity so we blew into her through our angel and we made her and her son a sign for the worlds indeed this your religion is one religion and i am your lord so worship me and they divided their affair among themselves all to us will return so whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer no denial will there be for his effort and indeed we of it are recorders and it is prohibited to a city which we have destroyed that they will return until when gog and magog has been opened and they from every elevation descend and the true promise has approached then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring ""o woe to us we had been unmindful of this rather we were wrongdoers"" indeed you and what you worship other than allāh are the firewood of hell you will be coming to it had these been gods they would not have come to it but all are eternal therein for them therein is heavy sighing and they therein will not hear indeed those for whom the best has preceded from us they are from it far removed they will not hear its sound while they are in that which their souls desire abiding eternally they will not be grieved by the greatest terror and the angels will meet them ""this is your day which you have been promised"" the day when we will fold the heaven like the folding of a sheet for the records as we began the first creation we will repeat it a promise binding upon us indeed we will do it and we have already written in the book after the mention that the land is inherited by my righteous servants indeed in this is notification for a worshipping people and we have not sent you except as a mercy to the worlds say ""it is only revealed to me that your god is but one god so will you be muslims ?"" but if they turn away then say ""i have announced to you equally and i know not whether near or far is that which you are promised indeed he knows what is declared of speech and he knows what you conceal and i know not perhaps it is a trial for you and enjoyment for a time"" has said ""my lord judge in truth and our lord is the most merciful the one whose help is sought against that which you describe"""

and thus have we sent it down as verses of clear evidence and because allāh guides whom he intends indeed those who have believed and those who were jews and the sabeans and the christians and the magians and those who associated with allāh allāh will judge between them on the day of resurrection indeed allāh is over all things witness do you not see that to allāh prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun the moon the stars the mountains the trees the moving creatures and many of the people? but upon many the punishment has been justified and he whom allāh humiliates for him there is no bestower of honor indeed allāh does what he wills these are two adversaries who have disputed over their lord but those who disbelieved will have cut out for them garments of fire poured upon their heads will be scalding water by which is melted that within their bellies and skins and for them are maces of iron every time they want to get out of it from anguish they will be returned to it and ""taste the punishment of the burning fire!"" indeed allāh will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl and their garments therein will be silk and they had been guided to good speech and they were guided to the path of the praiseworthy indeed those who have disbelieved and avert from the way of allāh and almasjid alḥarām which we made for the people equal are the resident therein and one from outside and whoever intends therein of deviation by wrongdoing we will make him taste of a painful punishment and when we designated for abraham the site of the house ""do not associate anything with me and purify my house for those who perform ṭawāf and those who stand and those who bow and prostrate and proclaim to the people the ḥajj they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel they will come from every distant pass that they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of allāh on known days over what he has provided for them of animals so eat of them and feed the miserable and poor then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform ṭawāf around the ancient house"" that and whoever honors the sacred ordinances of allāh it is best for him in the sight of his lord and permitted to you are the grazing livestock except what is recited to you so avoid the uncleanliness of idols and avoid false statement inclining to allāh not associating with him and he who associates with allāh it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place that and whoever honors the symbols of allāh indeed it is from the piety of hearts for you therein are benefits for a specified term then their place of sacrifice is at the ancient house and for every community we have appointed a rite that they may mention the name of allāh over what he has provided for them of animals for your god is one god so to him submit and give good tidings to the humble who when allāh is mentioned their hearts are fearful and the patient over what has afflicted them and the establishers of prayer and those who spend from what we have provided them and the camels and cattle we have appointed for you as among the symbols of allāh for you therein is good so mention the name of allāh upon them when lined up and when they are on their sides then eat from them and feed the needy and the beggar thus have we subjected them to you that you may be grateful their meat will not reach allāh nor will their blood but what reaches him is piety from you thus have we subjected them to you that you may glorify allāh for that which he has guided you and give good tidings to the doers of good indeed allāh defends those who have believed indeed allāh does not like everyone treacherous and ungrateful permission has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged and indeed allāh is competent to give them victory those who have been evicted from their homes without right only because they say ""our lord is allāh"" and were it not that allāh checks the people some by means of others there would have been demolished monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which the name of allāh is much mentioned and allāh will surely support those who support him indeed allāh is powerful and exalted in might those who if we give them authority in the land establish prayer and give zakāh and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and to allāh belongs the outcome of matters and if they deny you  so before them did the people of noah and ʿaad and thamūd deny and the people of abraham and the people of lot and the inhabitants of madyan and moses was denied so i prolonged enjoyment for the disbelievers then i seized them and how was my reproach and how many a city did we destroy while it was committing wrong so it is fallen into ruin and an abandoned well and a lofty palace so have they not traveled through the earth and have hearts by which to reason and ears by which to hear? for indeed it is not eyes that are blinded but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts and they urge you to hasten the punishment but allāh will never fail in his promise and indeed a day with your lord is like a thousand years of those which you count and for how many a city did i prolong enjoyment while it was committing wrong then i seized it and to me is the destination say ""o people i am only to you a clear warner"" and those who have believed and done righteous deeds for them is forgiveness and noble provision but the ones who strove against our verses to cause failure those are the companions of hellfire and we did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke satan threw into it but allāh abolishes that which satan throws in then allāh makes precise his verses and allāh is knowing and wise so he may make what satan throws in a trial for those within whose hearts is disease and those hard of heart and indeed the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension and so those who were given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your lord and believe in it and their hearts humbly submit to it and indeed is allāh the guide of those who have believed to a straight path but those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it until the hour comes upon them unexpectedly or there comes to them the punishment of a barren day sovereignty that day is for allāh he will judge between them so they who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the gardens of pleasure and they who disbelieved and denied our signs for those there will be a humiliating punishment and those who emigrated for the cause of allāh and then were killed or died allāh will surely provide for them a good provision and indeed it is allāh who is the best of providers he will surely cause them to enter an entrance with which they will be pleased and indeed allāh is knowing and forbearing that and whoever responds with the equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is tyrannized allāh will surely aid him indeed allāh is pardoning and forgiving that is because allāh causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and because allāh is hearing and seeing that is because allāh is the true reality and that which they call upon other than him is falsehood and because allāh is the most high the grand do you not see that allāh has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes green? indeed allāh is subtle and aware to him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and indeed allāh is the free of need the praiseworthy do you not see that allāh has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by his command? and he restrains the sky from falling upon the earth unless by his permission indeed allāh to the people is kind and merciful and he is the one who gave you life then he causes you to die and then will give you life indeed mankind is ungrateful for every community we have appointed rites which they perform so let them not contend with you over the matter but invite to your lord indeed you are upon straight guidance and if they dispute with you then say ""allāh is most knowing of what you do allāh will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ"" do you not know that allāh knows what is in the heaven and earth? indeed that is in a record indeed that for allāh is easy and they worship besides allāh that for which he has not sent down authority and that of which they have no knowledge and there will not be for the wrongdoers any helper and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval they are almost on the verge of assaulting those who recite to them our verses say ""then shall i inform you of worse than that? the fire which allāh has promised those who disbelieve and wretched is the destination"" o people an example is presented so listen to it indeed those you invoke besides allāh will never create a fly even if they gathered together for it and if the fly should steal from them a thing they could not recover it from him weak are the pursuer and pursued they have not appraised allāh with true appraisal indeed allāh is powerful and exalted in might allāh chooses from the angels messengers and from the people indeed allāh is hearing and seeing he knows what is before them and what will be after them and to allāh will be returned matters o you who have believed bow and prostrate and worship your lord and do good that you may succeed and strive for allāh with the striving due to him he has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty the religion of your father abraham he named you ""muslims"" before and in this that the messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people so establish prayer and give zakāh and hold fast to allāh he is your protector and excellent is the protector and excellent is the helper"
23,17.10924369747899,2036,119,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful certainly will the believers have succeeded they who are during their prayer humbly intent and they who turn away from ill speech and they who are observant of zakāh and they who guard their private parts except from their wives or those their right hands possess for indeed they will not be blamed but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors and they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive and they who carefully maintain their prayers those are the inheritors who will inherit alfirdaus they will abide therein eternally and certainly did we create man from an extract of clay then we placed him as a spermdrop in a firm lodging then we made the spermdrop into a clinging clot and we made the clot into a lump and we made the lump bones and we covered the bones with flesh then we developed him into another creation so blessed is allāh the best of creators then indeed after that you are to die then indeed you on the day of resurrection will be resurrected and we have created above you seven layered heavens and never have we been of creation unaware and we have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth and indeed we are able to take it away and we brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from which you eat and a tree issuing from mount sinai which produces oil and food for those who eat and indeed for you in livestock is a lesson we give you drink from that which is in their bellies and for you in them are numerous benefits and from them you eat and upon them and on ships you are carried and we had certainly sent noah to his people and he said ""o my people worship allāh you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him?"" but the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said ""this is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to take precedence over you and if allāh had willed he would have sent down angels we have not heard of this among our forefathers he is not but a man possessed with madness so wait concerning him for a time"" said ""my lord support me because they have denied me"" so we inspired to him ""construct the ship under our observation and our inspiration and when our command comes and the oven overflows put into it from each two mates and your family except him for whom the decree has proceeded and do not address me concerning those who have wronged indeed they are to be drowned and when you have boarded the ship you and those with you then say 'praise to allāh who has saved us from the wrongdoing people' and say 'my lord let me land at a blessed landing place and you are the best to accommodate '"" indeed in that are signs and indeed we are ever testing then we produced after them a generation of others and we sent among them a messenger from themselves ""worship allāh you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him?"" and the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the hereafter while we had given them luxury in the worldly life said ""this is not but a man like yourselves he eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink and if you should obey a man like yourselves indeed you would then be losers does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones that you will be brought forth ? how far how far is that which you are promised it is not but our worldly life we die and live but we will not be resurrected he is not but a man who has invented a lie about allāh and we will not believe him"" he said ""my lord support me because they have denied me"" said ""after a little they will surely become regretful"" so the shriek seized them in truth and we made them as stubble then away with the wrongdoing people then we produced after them other generations no nation will precede its time nor will they remain then we sent our messengers in succession every time there came to a nation its messenger they denied him so we made them follow one another and we made them narrations so away with a people who do not believe then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a clear authority to pharaoh and his establishment but they were arrogant and were a haughty people they said ""should we believe two men like ourselves while their people are for us in servitude?"" so they denied them and were of those destroyed and we certainly gave moses the scripture that perhaps they would be guided and we made the son of mary and his mother a sign and sheltered them within a high ground having level and flowing water ""o messengers eat from the good foods and work righteousness indeed i of what you do am knowing and indeed this your religion is one religion and i am your lord so fear me"" but they divided their religion among them into portions  each faction in what it has rejoicing so leave them in their confusion for a time do they think that what we extend to them of wealth and children is we hasten for them good things? rather they do not perceive indeed they who are apprehensive from fear of their lord and they who believe in the signs of their lord and they who do not associate anything with their lord and they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their lord it is those who hasten to good deeds and they outstrip therein and we charge no soul except its capacity and with us is a record which speaks with truth and they will not be wronged but their hearts are covered with confusion over this and they have deeds besides that which they are doing until when we seize their affluent ones with punishment at once they are crying for help do not cry out today indeed by us you will not be helped my verses had already been recited to you but you were turning back on your heels in arrogance regarding it conversing by night speaking evil then have they not reflected over the word or has there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers? or did they not know their messenger so they are toward him disacknowledging? or do they say ""in him is madness""? rather he brought them the truth but most of them to the truth are averse but if the truth had followed their inclinations the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined rather we have brought them their message but they from their message are turning away or do you ask them for payment? but the reward of your lord is best and he is the best of providers and indeed you invite them to a straight path but indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the path and even if we gave them mercy and removed what was upon them of affliction they would persist in their transgression wandering blindly and we had gripped them with suffering but they did not yield to their lord nor did they humbly supplicate until when we have opened before them a door of severe punishment immediately they will be therein in despair and it is he who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful and it is he who has multiplied you throughout the earth and to him you will be gathered and it is he who gives life and causes death and his is the alternation of the night and the day then will you not reason? rather they say like what the former peoples said they said ""when we have died and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected? we have been promised this we and our forefathers before this is not but legends of the former peoples"" say ""to whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it if you should know?"" they will say ""to allāh"" say ""then will you not remember?"" say ""who is lord of the seven heavens and lord of the great throne?"" they will say "" to allāh"" say ""then will you not fear him?"" say ""in whose hand is the realm of all things and he protects while none can protect against him if you should know?"" they will say "" to allāh"" say ""then how are you deluded?"" rather we have brought them the truth and indeed they are liars allāh has not taken any son nor has there ever been with him any deity then each deity would have taken what it created and some of them would have overcome others exalted is allāh above what they describe knower of the unseen and the witnessed so high is he above what they associate say ""my lord if you should show me that which they are promised my lord then do not place me among the wrongdoing people"" and indeed we are able to show you what we have promised them repel by what is best evil we are most knowing of what they describe and say ""my lord i seek refuge in you from the incitements of the devils and i seek refuge in you my lord lest they be present with me"" until when death comes to one of them he says ""my lord send me back that i might do righteousness in that which i left behind"" no! it is only a word he is saying and behind them is a barrier until the day they are resurrected so when the horn is blown no relationship will there be among them that day nor will they ask about one another and those whose scales are heavy  it is they who are the successful but those whose scales are light those are the ones who have lost their souls in hell abiding eternally the fire will sear their faces and they therein will have taut smiles ""were not my verses recited to you and you used to deny them?"" they will say ""our lord our wretchedness overcame us and we were a people astray our lord remove us from it and if we were to return we would indeed be wrongdoers"" he will say ""remain despised therein and do not speak to me indeed there was a party of my servants who said 'our lord we have believed so forgive us and have mercy upon us and you are the best of the merciful' but you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget my remembrance and you used to laugh at them indeed i have rewarded them this day for their patient endurance that they are the attainers "" will say ""how long did you remain on earth in number of years?"" they will say ""we remained a day or part of a day ask those who enumerate"" he will say ""you stayed not but a little if only you had known then did you think that we created you uselessly and that to us you would not be returned?"" so exalted is allāh the sovereign the truth there is no deity except him lord of the noble throne and whoever invokes besides allāh another deity for which he has no proof then his account is only with his lord indeed the disbelievers will not succeed and say ""my lord forgive and have mercy and you are the best of the merciful"""

why did they not produce for it four witnesses? and when they do not produce the witnesses then it is they in the sight of allāh who are the liars and if it had not been for the favor of allāh upon you and his mercy in this world and the hereafter you would have been touched for that in which you were involved by a great punishment when you received it with your tongues and said with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it was insignificant while it was in the sight of allāh tremendous and why when you heard it did you not say ""it is not for us to speak of this exalted are you this is a great slander""? allāh warns you against returning to the likes of this ever if you should be believers and allāh makes clear to you the verses and allāh is knowing and wise indeed those who like that immorality should be spread among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter and allāh knows and you do not know and if it had not been for the favor of allāh upon you and his mercy and because allāh is kind and merciful o you who have believed do not follow the footsteps of satan and whoever follows the footsteps of satan indeed he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing and if not for the favor of allāh upon you and his mercy not one of you would have been pure ever but allāh purifies whom he wills and allāh is hearing and knowing and let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants for the cause of allāh and let them pardon and overlook would you not like that allāh should forgive you? and allāh is forgiving and merciful indeed those who accuse chaste unaware and believing women are cursed in this world and the hereafter and they will have a great punishment on a day when their tongues their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do that day allāh will pay them in full their true recompense and they will know that it is allāh who is the manifest truth evil words are for evil men and evil men are to evil words and good words are for good men and good men are of good words those are declared innocent of what they say for them is forgiveness and noble provision o you who have believed do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet their inhabitants that is best for you perhaps you will be reminded and if you do not find anyone therein do not enter them until permission has been given you and if it is said to you ""go back"" then go back it is purer for you and allāh is knowing of what you do there is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is convenience for you and allāh knows what you reveal and what you conceal tell the believing men to reduce of their vision and guard their private parts that is purer for them indeed allāh is aware of what they do and tell the believing women to reduce of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which appears thereof and to wrap their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands their fathers their husbands' fathers their sons their husbands' sons their brothers their brothers' sons their sisters' sons their women that which their right hands possess or those male attendants having no physical desire or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women and let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment and turn to allāh in repentance all of you o believers that you might succeed and marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves if they should be poor allāh will enrich them from his bounty and allāh is allencompassing and knowing but let them who find not marriage abstain until allāh enriches them from his bounty and those who seek a contract from among whom your right hands possess then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of allāh which he has given you and do not compel your slave girls to prostitution if they desire chastity to seek the temporary interests of worldly life and if someone should compel them then indeed allāh is after their compulsion forgiving and merciful and we have certainly sent down to you distinct verses and examples from those who passed on before you and an admonition for those who fear allāh allāh is the light of the heavens and the earth the example of his light is like a niche within which is a lamp the lamp is within glass the glass as if it were a pearly star lit from a blessed olive tree neither of the east nor of the west whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire light upon light allāh guides to his light whom he wills and allāh presents examples for the people and allāh is knowing of all things in houses which allāh has ordered to be raised and that his name be mentioned therein exalting him within them in the morning and the evenings men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of allāh and performance of prayer and giving of zakāh they fear a day in which the hearts and eyes will turn about that allāh may reward them the best of what they did and increase them from his bounty and allāh gives provision to whom he wills without account but those who disbelieved their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until when he comes to it he finds it is nothing but finds allāh before him and he will pay him in full his due and allāh is swift in account or like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves upon which are waves over which are clouds darknesses some of them upon others when one puts out his hand he can hardly see it and he to whom allāh has not granted light for him there is no light do you not see that allāh is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and the birds with wings spread ? each has known his prayer and exalting and allāh is knowing of what they do and to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and to allāh is the destination do you not see that allāh drives clouds? then he brings them together then he makes them into a mass and you see the rain emerge from within it and he sends down from the sky mountains within which is hail and he strikes with it whom he wills and averts it from whom he wills the flash of its lightning almost takes away the eyesight allāh alternates the night and the day indeed in that is a lesson for those who have vision allāh has created every creature from water and of them are those that move on their bellies and of them are those that walk on two legs and of them are those that walk on four allāh creates what he wills indeed allāh is over all things competent we have certainly sent down distinct verses and allāh guides whom he wills to a straight path but they say ""we have believed in allāh and in the messenger and we obey"" then a party of them turns away after that and those are not believers and when they are called to allāh and his messenger to judge between them at once a party of them turns aside but if the right is theirs they come to him in prompt obedience is there disease in their hearts? or have they doubted? or do they fear that allāh will be unjust to them or his messenger? rather it is they who are the wrongdoers the only statement of the believers when they are called to allāh and his messenger to judge between them is that they say ""we hear and we obey"" and those are the successful and whoever obeys allāh and his messenger and fears allāh and is conscious of him it is those who are the attainers and they swear by allāh their strongest oaths that if you ordered them they would go forth say ""do not swear obedience is known indeed allāh is aware of that which you do"" say ""obey allāh and obey the messenger but if you turn away then upon him is only that with which he has been charged and upon you is that with which you have been charged and if you obey him you will be guided and there is not upon the messenger except the clear notification"" allāh has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that he will surely grant them succession upon the earth just as he granted it to those before them and that he will surely establish for them their religion which he has preferred for them and that he will surely substitute for them after their fear security they worship me not associating anything with me but whoever disbelieves after that then those are the defiantly disobedient and establish prayer and give zakāh and obey the messenger that you may receive mercy never think that the disbelievers are causing failure upon the earth their refuge will be the fire and how wretched the destination o you who have believed let those whom your right hands possess and those who have not reached puberty among you ask permission of you at three times before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing at noon and after the night prayer three times of privacy for you there is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these for they continually circulate among you some of you among others thus does allāh make clear to you the verses and allāh is knowing and wise and when the children among you reach puberty let them ask permission as those before them have done thus does allāh make clear to you his verses and allāh is knowing and wise and women of postmenstrual age who have no desire for marriage there is no blame upon them for putting aside their outer garments not displaying adornment but to modestly refrain is better for them and allāh is hearing and knowing there is not upon the blind constraint nor upon the lame constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselves when you eat from your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your father's brothers or the houses of your father's sisters or the houses of your mother's brothers or the houses of your mother's sisters or whose keys you possess or of your friend there is no blame upon you whether you eat together or separately but when you enter houses give greetings of peace upon each other a greeting from allāh blessed and good thus does allāh make clear to you the verses that you may understand the believers are only those who believe in allāh and his messenger and when they are with him for a matter of common interest do not depart until they have asked his permission indeed those who ask your permission  those are the ones who believe in allāh and his messenger so when they ask your permission due to something of their affairs then give permission to whom you will among them and ask forgiveness for them of allāh indeed allāh is forgiving and merciful do not make calling of the messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another already allāh knows those of you who slip away concealed by others so let those beware who dissent from his order lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment unquestionably to allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth already he knows that upon which you and the day when they will be returned to him and he will inform them of what they have done and allāh is knowing of all things"

and ever is your lord seeing and those who do not expect the meeting with us say ""why were not angels sent down to us or do we see our lord?"" they have certainly become arrogant within themselves and insolent with great insolence the day they see the angels no good tidings will there be that day for the criminals and will say ""prevented and inaccessible"" and we will approach what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed the companions of paradise that day are a better settlement and better resting place and the day when the heaven will split open with clouds and the angels will be sent down in successive descent true sovereignty that day is for the most merciful and it will be upon the disbelievers a difficult day and the day the wrongdoer will bite on his hands he will say ""oh i wish i had taken with the messenger a way oh woe to me! i wish i had not taken that one as a friend he led me away from the remembrance after it had come to me and ever is satan to man a deserter"" and the messenger has said ""o my lord indeed my people have taken this qur’ān as abandoned"" and thus have we made for every prophet an enemy from among the criminals but sufficient is your lord as a guide and a helper and those who disbelieve say ""why was the qur’ān not revealed to him all at once?"" thus that we may strengthen thereby your heart and we have spaced it distinctly and they do not come to you with an example except that we bring you the truth and the best explanation the ones who are gathered on their faces to hell those are the worst in position and farthest astray in way and we had certainly given moses the scripture and appointed with him his brother aaron as an assistant and we said ""go both of you to the people who have denied our signs"" then we destroyed them with destruction and the people of noah when they denied the messengers we drowned them and we made them for mankind a sign and we have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment and ʿaad and thamūd and the companions of the well and many generations between them and for each we presented examples and each we destroyed with destruction and they have already come upon the town which was showered with a rain of evil so have they not seen it? but they are not expecting resurrection and when they see you they take you not except in ridicule ""is this the one whom allāh has sent as a messenger? he almost would have misled us from our gods had we not been steadfast in them"" but they are going to know when they see the punishment who is farthest astray in way have you seen the one who takes as his god his own desire?

then we made the sun for it an indication then we hold it with us for a brief grasp and it is he who has made the night for you as clothing and sleep rest and has made the day a resurrection and it is he who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy and we send down from the sky pure water that we may bring to life thereby a dead land and give it as drink to those we created of numerous livestock and men and we have certainly distributed it among them that they might be reminded but most of the people refuse except disbelief and if we had willed we could have sent into every city a warner so do not obey the disbelievers and strive against them with it a great striving and it is he who has released the two seas one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter and he placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition and it is he who has created from water a human being and made him lineage and marriage and ever is your lord competent but they worship rather than allāh that which does not benefit them or harm them and the disbeliever is ever against his lord an assistant and we have not sent you except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner say ""i do not ask of you for it any payment only that whoever wills might take to his lord a way"" and rely upon the everliving who does not die and exalt with his praise and sufficient is he to be with the sins of his servants aware he who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days and then established himself above the throne the most merciful so ask about him one well informed and when it is said to them ""prostrate to the most merciful"" they say ""and what is the most merciful? should we prostrate to that which you order us?"" and it increases them in aversion blessed is he who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a lamp and luminous moon and it is he who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude and the servants of the most merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily and when the ignorant address them they say peace and those who spend the night to their lord prostrating and standing and those who say ""our lord avert from us the punishment of hell indeed its punishment is ever adhering indeed it is evil as a settlement and residence"" and those who when they spend do so not excessively or sparingly but are ever between that moderate and those who do not invoke with allāh another deity or kill the soul which allāh has forbidden except by right and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse and whoever should do that will meet a penalty multiplied for him is the punishment on the day of resurrection and he will abide therein humiliated except for those who repent believe and do righteous work for them allāh will replace their evil deeds with good and ever is allāh forgiving and merciful and he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to allāh with repentance and those who do not testify to falsehood and when they pass near ill speech they pass by with dignity and those who when reminded of the verses of their lord do not fall upon them deaf and blind and those who say ""our lord grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us a leader for the righteous"" those will be awarded the chamber for what they patiently endured and they will be received therein with greetings and peace abiding eternally therein good is the settlement and residence say ""what would my lord care for you if not for your supplication?"" for you have denied so it is going to be adherent"

indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful and when your lord called moses ""go to the wrongdoing people the people of pharaoh will they not fear allāh?"" he said ""my lord indeed i fear that they will deny me and that my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent so send for aaron and they have upon me a sin so i fear that they will kill me"" said ""no go both of you with our signs indeed we are with you listening go to pharaoh and say 'we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds ""send with us the children of israel""'"" said ""did we not raise you among us as a child and you remained among us for years of your life? and you did your deed which you did and you were of the ungrateful"" said ""i did it then while i was of those astray so i fled from you when i feared you then my lord granted me judgement and appointed me of the messengers and is this a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of israel?"" said pharaoh ""and what is the lord of the worlds?"" said ""the lord of the heavens and earth and that between them if you should be convinced"" said to those around him ""do you not hear?"" said ""your lord and the lord of your first forefathers"" said ""indeed your 'messenger' who has been sent to you is mad"" said ""lord of the east and the west and that between them if you were to reason"" said ""if you take a god other than me i will surely place you among those imprisoned"" said ""even if i brought you something manifest?"" said ""then bring it if you should be of the truthful"" so threw his staff and suddenly it was a serpent manifest and he drew out his hand thereupon it was white for the observers said to the eminent ones around him ""indeed this is a learned magician he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic so what do you advise?"" they said ""postpone him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers who will bring you every learned skilled magician"" so the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a wellknown day and it was said to the people ""will you congregate that we might follow the magicians if they are the predominant?"" and when the magicians arrived they said to pharaoh ""is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant?"" he said ""yes and indeed you will then be of those near "" moses said to them ""throw whatever you will throw"" so they threw their ropes and their staffs and said ""by the might of pharaoh indeed it is we who are predominant"" then moses threw his staff and at once it devoured what they falsified so the magicians fell down in prostration they said ""we have believed in the lord of the worlds the lord of moses and aaron"" said ""you believed him before i gave you permission indeed he is your leader who has taught you magic but you are going to know i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i will surely crucify you all"" they said ""no harm indeed to our lord we will return indeed we aspire that our lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers"" and we inspired to moses ""travel by night with my servants indeed you will be pursued"" then pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers ""indeed those are but a small band and indeed they are enraging us and indeed we are a cautious society"" so we removed them from gardens and springs and treasures and honorable station thus and we caused to inherit it the children of israel so they pursued them at sunrise and when the two companies saw one another the companions of moses said ""indeed we are to be overtaken!"" said ""no! indeed with me is my lord he will guide me"" then we inspired to moses ""strike with your staff the sea"" and it parted and each portion was like a great towering mountain and we advanced thereto the others and we saved moses and those with him all together then we drowned the others indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful and recite to them the news of abraham when he said to his father and his people ""what do you worship?"" they said ""we worship idols and remain to them devoted"" he said ""do they hear you when you supplicate? or do they benefit you or do they harm?"" they said ""but we found our fathers doing thus"" he said ""then do you see what you have been worshipping you and your ancient forefathers? indeed they are enemies to me except the lord of the worlds who created me and he guides me and it is he who feeds me and gives me drink and when i am ill it is he who cures me and who will cause me to die and then bring me to life and who i aspire that he will forgive me my sin on the day of recompense"" ""my lord grant me authority and join me with the righteous and grant me a mention of honor among later generations and place me among the inheritors of the garden of pleasure and forgive my father indeed he has been of those astray and do not disgrace me on the day they are resurrected the day when there will not benefit wealth or children but only one who comes to allāh with a sound heart"" and paradise will be brought near to the righteous and hellfire will be brought forth for the deviators and it will be said to them ""where are those you used to worship other than allāh?

indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger so fear allāh and obey me and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds so fear allāh and obey me"" they said ""should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest ?"" he said ""and what is my knowledge of what they used to do? their account is only upon my lord if you perceive and i am not one to drive away the believers i am only a clear warner"" they said ""if you do not desist o noah you will surely be of those who are stoned"" he said ""my lord indeed my people have denied me then judge between me and them with decisive judgement and save me and those with me of the believers"" so we saved him and those with him in the laden ship then we drowned thereafter the remaining ones indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful ʿaad denied the messengers when their brother hūd said to them ""will you not fear allāh?

indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger so fear allāh and obey me and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds do you approach males among the worlds and leave what your lord has created for you as mates? but you are a people transgressing"" they said ""if you do not desist o lot you will surely be of those evicted"" he said ""indeed i am toward your deed of those who detest my lord save me and my family from what they do"" so we saved him and his family all except an old woman among those who remained behind then we destroyed the others and we rained upon them a rain and evil was the rain of those who were warned indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful the companions of the thicket denied the messengers when shuʿayb said to them ""will you not fear allāh? indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger so fear allāh and obey me and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds give full measure and do not be of those who cause loss and weigh with an even balance and do not deprive people of their due and do not commit abuse on earth spreading corruption and fear he who created you and the former creation"" they said ""you are only of those affected by magic you are but a man like ourselves and indeed we think you are among the liars so cause to fall upon us fragments of the sky if you should be of the truthful"" he said ""my lord is most knowing of what you do"" and they denied him so the punishment of the day of the black cloud seized them indeed it was the punishment of a terrible day indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful and indeed it is the revelation of the lord of the worlds the trustworthy spirit has brought it down upon your heart  that you may be of the warners in a clear arabic language and indeed it is in the scriptures of former peoples and has it not been a sign to them that it is recognized by the scholars of the children of israel? and even if we had revealed it to one among the foreigners and he had recited it to them they would not have been believers in it thus have we inserted it into the hearts of the criminals they will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment and it will come to them suddenly while they perceive not and they will say ""may we be reprieved?"" so for our punishment are they impatient? then have you considered if we gave them enjoyment for years and then there came to them that which they were promised? they would not be availed by the enjoyment with which they were provided and we did not destroy any city except that it had warners as a reminder and never have we been unjust and the devils have not brought it down it is not allowable for them nor would they be able indeed they from hearing are removed so do not invoke with allāh another deity and be among the punished and warn your closest kindred and lower your wing to those who follow you of the believers and if they disobey you then say ""indeed i am disassociated from what you are doing"" and rely upon the exalted in might the merciful who sees you when you arise and your movement among those who prostrate indeed he is the hearing the knowing shall i inform you upon whom the devils descend? they descend upon every sinful liar they pass on what is heard and most of them are liars and the poets  the deviators follow them do you not see that in every valley they roam and that they say what they do not do? except those who believe and do righteous deeds and remember allāh often and defend after they were wronged and those who have wronged are going to know to what return they will be returned"

i will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization"" but he stayed not long and said ""i have encompassed that which you have not encompassed and i have come to you from sheba with certain news indeed i found a woman ruling them and she has been given of all things and she has a great throne i found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of allāh and satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from way so they are not guided so they do not prostrate to allāh who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare allāh there is no deity except him lord of the great throne"" said ""we will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars take this letter of mine and deliver it to them then leave them and see what they will return"" she said ""o eminent ones indeed to me has been delivered a noble letter indeed it is from solomon and indeed it is 'in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful be not haughty with me but come to me in submission '"" she said ""o eminent ones advise me in my affair i would not decide a matter until you witness me"" they said ""we are men of strength and of great military might but the command is yours so see what you will command"" she said ""indeed kings when they enter a city they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled and thus do they do but indeed i will send to them a gift and see with what the messengers will return"" so when they came to solomon he said ""do you provide me with wealth?

why do you not seek forgiveness of allāh that you may receive mercy?"" they said ""we consider you a bad omen you and those with you"" he said ""your omen is with allāh rather you are a people being tested"" and there were in the city nine family heads causing corruption in the land and not amending they said ""take a mutual oath by allāh that we will kill him by night he and his family then we will say to his executor 'we did not witness the destruction of his family and indeed we are truthful'"" and they planned a plan and we planned a plan while they perceived not then look how was the outcome of their plan that we destroyed them and their people all so those are their houses desolate because of the wrong they had done indeed in that is a sign for people who know and we saved those who believed and used to fear allāh and lot when he said to his people ""do you commit immorality while you are seeing?

is there a deity with allāh? but most of them do not know is he who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? is there a deity with allāh? little do you remember is he who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy? is there a deity with allāh? high is allāh above whatever they associate with him is he who begins creation and then repeats it and who provides for you from the heaven and earth? is there a deity with allāh? say ""produce your proof if you should be truthful"" say ""none in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except allāh and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected"" rather their knowledge is arrested concerning the hereafter rather they are in doubt about it rather they are concerning it blind and those who disbelieve say ""when we have become dust as well as our forefathers will we indeed be brought out ? we have been promised this we and our forefathers before this is not but legends of the former peoples"" say ""proceed through the land and observe how was the end of the criminals"" and grieve not over them or be in distress from what they conspire and they say ""when is this promise if you should be truthful?"" say ""perhaps it is close behind you  some of that for which you are impatient and indeed your lord is the possessor of bounty for the people but most of them are not grateful"" and indeed your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare and there is nothing concealed within the heaven and the earth except that it is in a clear register indeed this qur’ān relates to the children of israel most of that over which they disagree and indeed it is guidance and mercy for the believers indeed your lord will judge between them by his judgement and he is the exalted in might the knowing so rely upon allāh indeed you are upon the clear truth indeed you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating and you cannot guide the blind away from their error you will only make hear those who believe in our verses so they are muslims and when the word befalls them we will bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to them that the people were of our verses not certain and the day when we will gather from every nation a company of those who deny our signs and they will be in rows until when they arrive he will say ""did you deny my signs while you encompassed them not in knowledge or what you were doing?"" and the decree will befall them for the wrong they did and they will not speak do they not see that we made the night that they may rest therein and the day giving sight?

you only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders"" and a man came from the farthest end of the city running he said ""o moses indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you to kill you so leave indeed i am to you of the sincere advisors"" so he left it fearful and anticipating he said ""my lord save me from the wrongdoing people"" and when he directed himself toward madyan he said ""perhaps my lord will guide me to the sound way"" and when he came to the water of madyan he found there a crowd of people watering and he found aside from them two women holding back he said ""what is your circumstance?"" they said ""we do not water until the shepherds dispatch and our father is an old man"" so he watered for them then he went back to the shade and said ""my lord indeed i am for whatever good you would send down to me in need"" then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness she said ""indeed my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us"" so when he came to him and related to him the story he said ""fear not you have escaped from the wrongdoing people"" one of the women said ""o my father hire him indeed the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy"" he said ""indeed i wish to wed you one of these my two daughters on that you serve me for eight years but if you complete ten it will be from you and i do not wish to put you in difficulty you will find me if allāh wills from among the righteous"" said ""that is between me and you whichever of the two terms i complete there is no injustice to me and allāh over what we say is witness"" and when moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire he said to his family ""stay here indeed i have perceived a fire perhaps i will bring you from there information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves"" but when he came to it he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot from the tree ""o moses indeed i am allāh lord of the worlds"" and ""throw down your staff"" but when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake he turned in flight and did not return ""o moses approach and fear not indeed you are of the secure insert your hand into the opening of your garment it will come out white without disease and draw in your arm close to you from fear for those are two proofs from your lord to pharaoh and his establishment indeed they have been a people defiantly disobedient"" he said ""my lord indeed i killed from among them someone and i fear they will kill me and my brother aaron is more fluent than me in tongue so send him with me as support verifying me indeed i fear that they will deny me"" said ""we will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you through our signs you and those who follow you will be the predominant"" but when moses came to them with our signs as clear evidences they said ""this is not except invented magic and we have not heard of this among our forefathers"" and moses said ""my lord is more knowing of who has come with guidance from him and to whom will be succession in the home indeed wrongdoers do not succeed"" and pharaoh said ""o eminent ones i have not known you to have a god other than me then ignite for me o hāmān upon the clay and make for me a tower that i may look at the god of moses and indeed i do think he is among the liars"" and he was arrogant he and his soldiers in the land without right and they thought that they would not be returned to us so we took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea so see how was the end of the wrongdoers and we made them leaders inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped and we caused to overtake them in this world a curse and on the day of resurrection they will be of the despised and we gave moses the scripture after we had destroyed the former generations as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded and you were not on the western side when we revealed to moses the command and you were not among the witnesses but we produced generations and prolonged was their duration and you were not a resident among the people of madyan reciting to them our verses but we were senders and you were not at the side of the mount when we called but as a mercy from your lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded and if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth and they would say ""our lord why did you not send us a messenger so we could have followed your verses and been among the believers?"" but when the truth came to them from us they said ""why was he not given like that which was given to moses?"" did they not disbelieve in that which was given to moses before? they said "" two works of magic supporting each other and indeed we are in both disbelievers"" say ""then bring a scripture from allāh which is more guiding than either of them that i may follow it if you should be truthful"" but if they do not respond to you then know that they only follow their desires and who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from allāh? indeed allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people and we have conveyed to them the word that they might be reminded those to whom we gave the scripture before it they are believers in it and when it is recited to them they say ""we have believed in it indeed it is the truth from our lord indeed we were before it muslims "" those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and they avert evil through good and from what we have provided them they spend and when they hear ill speech they turn away from it and say ""for us are our deeds and for you are your deeds peace will be upon you we seek not the ignorant"" indeed you do not guide whom you like but allāh guides whom he wills and he is most knowing of the guided and they say ""if we were to follow the guidance with you we would be swept from our land"" have we not established for them a safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from us? but most of them do not know and how many a city have we destroyed that was insolent in its living and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly and it is we who were the inheritors and never would your lord have destroyed the cities until he had sent to their mother a messenger reciting to them our verses and we would not destroy the cities except while their people were wrongdoers and whatever thing you have been given it is the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment and what is with allāh is better and more lasting so will you not use reason? then is he whom we have promised a good promise which he will meet like he for whom we provided enjoyment of worldly life then he is on the day of resurrection among those presented ? and the day he will call them and say ""where are my 'partners' which you used to claim?"" those upon whom the word will have come into effect will say ""our lord these are the ones we led to error we led them to error just as we were in error we declare our disassociation to you they did not used to worship us"" and it will be said ""invoke your 'partners'"" and they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and they will see the punishment if only they had followed guidance! and the day he will call them and say ""what did you answer the messengers?"" but the information will be unapparent to them that day so they will not ask one another but as for one who had repented believed and done righteousness it is expected that he will be among the successful and your lord creates what he wills and chooses not for them was the choice exalted is allāh and high above what they associate with him and your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare and he is allāh there is no deity except him to him is praise in the first and the hereafter and his is the decision and to him you will be returned say ""have you considered if allāh should make for you the night continuous until the day of resurrection what deity other than allāh could bring you light?

then will you not see?"" and out of his mercy he made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and seek from his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful and the day he will call them and say ""where are my 'partners' which you used to claim?"" and we will extract from every nation a witness and say ""produce your proof"" and they will know that the truth belongs to allāh and lost from them is that which they used to invent indeed qārūn was from the people of moses but he tyrannized them and we gave him of treasures whose keys would burden a band of strong men thereupon his people said to him ""do not exult indeed allāh does not like the exultant but seek through that which allāh has given you the home of the hereafter and do not forget your share of the world and do good as allāh has done good to you and desire not corruption in the land indeed allāh does not like corrupters"" he said ""i was only given it because of knowledge i have"" did he not know that allāh had destroyed before him of generations those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation ? but the criminals about their sins will not be asked so he came out before his people in his adornment those who desired the worldly life said ""oh would that we had like what was given to qārūn indeed he is one of great fortune"" but those who had been given knowledge said ""woe to you! the reward of allāh is better for he who believes and does righteousness and none are granted it except the patient"" and we caused the earth to swallow him and his home and there was for him no company to aid him other than allāh nor was he of those who defend themselves and those who had wished for his position the previous day began to say ""oh how allāh extends provision to whom he wills of his servants and restricts it! if not that allāh had conferred favor on us he would have caused it to swallow us oh how the disbelievers do not succeed!"" that home of the hereafter we assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption and the outcome is for the righteous whoever comes with a good deed will have better than it and whoever comes with an evil deed then those who did evil deeds will not be recompensed except what they used to do indeed he who imposed upon you the qur’ān will take you back to a place of return say ""my lord is most knowing of who brings guidance and who is in clear error"" and you were not expecting that the book would be conveyed to you but a mercy from your lord so do not be an assistant to the disbelievers and never let them avert you from the verses of allāh after they have been revealed to you and invite to your lord and never be of those who associate others with allāh and do not invoke with allāh another deity there is no deity except him everything will be destroyed except his face his is the judgement and to him you will be returned"

but we have certainly tried those before them and allāh will surely make evident those who are truthful and he will surely make evident the liars or do those who do evil deeds think they can outrun us? evil is what they judge whoever should hope for the meeting with allāh indeed the term allāh is coming and he is the hearing the knowing and whoever strives only strives for himself indeed allāh is free from need of the worlds and those who believe and do righteous deeds we will surely remove from them their misdeeds and will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do and we have enjoined upon man goodness to parents but if they endeavor to make you associate with me that of which you have no knowledge do not obey them to me is your return and i will inform you about what you used to do and those who believe and do righteous deeds we will surely admit them among the righteous and of the people are some who say ""we believe in allāh"" but when one is harmed for allāh he considers the trial of the people as the punishment of allāh but if victory comes from your lord they say ""indeed we were with you"" is not allāh most knowing of what is within the breasts of the worlds ? and allāh will surely make evident those who believe and he will surely make evident the hypocrites and those who disbelieve say to those who believe ""follow our way and we will carry your sins"" but they will not carry anything of their sins indeed they are liars but they will surely carry their burdens and burdens along with their burdens and they will surely be questioned on the day of resurrection about what they used to invent and we certainly sent noah to his people and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers but we saved him and the companions of the ship and we made it a sign for the worlds and abraham when he said to his people ""worship allāh and fear him that is best for you if you should know you only worship besides allāh idols and you produce a falsehood indeed those you worship besides allāh do not possess for you provision so seek from allāh provision and worship him and be grateful to him to him you will be returned"" and if you deny  already nations before you have denied and there is not upon the messenger except clear notification have they not considered how allāh begins creation and then repeats it? indeed that for allāh is easy say ""travel through the land and observe how he began creation then allāh will produce the final creation indeed allāh over all things is competent"" he punishes whom he wills and has mercy upon whom he wills and to him you will be returned and you will not cause failure upon the earth or in the heaven and you have not other than allāh any protector or any helper and the ones who disbelieve in the signs of allāh and the meeting with him those have despaired of my mercy and they will have a painful punishment and the answer of his people was not but that they said ""kill him or burn him"" but allāh saved him from the fire indeed in that are signs for a people who believe and said ""you have only taken other than allāh idols as affection among you in worldly life then on the day of resurrection you will deny one another and curse one another and your refuge will be the fire and you will not have any helpers"" and lot believed him said ""indeed i will emigrate to my lord indeed he is the exalted in might the wise"" and we gave to him isaac and jacob and placed in his descendants prophethood and scripture and we gave him his reward in this world and indeed he is in the hereafter among the righteous and lot when he said to his people ""indeed you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds indeed you approach men and obstruct the road and commit in your meetings evil"" and the answer of his people was not but that they said ""bring us the punishment of allāh if you should be of the truthful"" he said ""my lord support me against the corrupting people"" and when our messengers came to abraham with the good tidings they said ""indeed we will destroy the people of that city indeed its people have been wrongdoers"" said ""indeed within it is lot"" they said ""we are more knowing of who is within it we will surely save him and his family except his wife she is to be of those who remain behind"" and when our messengers came to lot he was distressed for them and felt for them great discomfort they said ""fear not nor grieve indeed we will save you and your family except your wife she is to be of those who remain behind indeed we will bring down on the people of this city punishment from the sky because they have been defiantly disobedient"" and we have certainly left of it a sign as clear evidence for a people who use reason and to madyan their brother shuʿayb and he said ""o my people worship allāh and expect the last day and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption"" but they denied him so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home fallen prone and ʿaad and thamūd and it has become clear to you from their dwellings and satan had made pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path and they were endowed with perception and qārūn and pharaoh and hāmān and moses had already come to them with clear evidences and they were arrogant in the land but they were not outrunners so each we seized for his sin and among them were those upon whom we sent a storm of stones and among them were those who were seized by the blast and among them were those whom we caused the earth to swallow and among them were those whom we drowned and allāh would not have wronged them but it was they who were wronging themselves the example of those who take allies other than allāh is like that of the spider who takes a home and indeed the weakest of homes is the home of the spider if they only knew indeed allāh knows whatever thing they call upon other than him and he is the exalted in might the wise and these examples we present to the people but none will understand them except those of knowledge allāh created the heavens and the earth in truth indeed in that is a sign for the believers recite what has been revealed to you of the book and establish prayer indeed prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing and the remembrance of allāh is greater and allāh knows that which you do and do not argue with the people of the scripture except in a way that is best except for those who commit injustice among them and say ""we believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you and our god and your god is one and we are muslims to him"" and thus we have sent down to you the book and those to whom we gave the scripture believe in it and among these are those who believe in it and none reject our verses except the disbelievers and you did not recite before it any scripture nor did you inscribe one with your right hand then the falsifiers would have had doubt rather it is distinct verses within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge and none reject our verses except the wrongdoers but they say ""why are not signs sent down to him from his lord?"" say ""the signs are only with allāh and i am only a clear warner"" and is it not sufficient for them that we revealed to you the book which is recited to them? indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe say ""sufficient is allāh between me and you as witness he knows what is in the heavens and earth and they who have believed in falsehood and disbelieved in allāh it is those who are the losers"" and they urge you to hasten the punishment and if not for a specified term punishment would have reached them but it will surely come to them suddenly while they perceive not they urge you to hasten the punishment and indeed hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers on the day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said ""taste what you used to do"" o my servants who have believed indeed my earth is spacious so worship only me every soul will taste death then to us will you be returned and those who have believed and done righteous deeds we will surely assign to them of paradise chambers beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally excellent is the reward of the workers who have been patient and upon their lord rely and how many a creature carries not its provision allāh provides for it and for you and he is the hearing the knowing if you asked them ""who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and the moon?"" they would surely say ""allāh"" then how are they deluded? allāh extends provision for whom he wills of his servants and restricts for him indeed allāh is of all things knowing and if you asked them ""who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness?"" they would surely say ""allāh"" say ""praise to allāh"" but most of them do not reason and this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement and indeed the home of the hereafter that is the life if only they knew and when they board a ship they supplicate allāh sincere to him in religion but when he delivers them to the land at once they associate others with him so that they will deny what we have granted them and they will enjoy themselves but they are going to know have they not seen that we made a safe sanctuary while people are being taken away all around them? then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of allāh they disbelieve? and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allāh or denies the truth when it has come to him? is there not in hell a residence for the disbelievers? and those who strive for us we will surely guide them to our ways and indeed allāh is with the doers of good"

allāh has not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term and indeed many of the people in the meeting with their lord are disbelievers have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? they were greater than them in power and they plowed the earth and built it up more than they have built it up and their messengers came to them with clear evidences and allāh would not ever have wronged them but they were wronging themselves then the end of those who did evil was the worst because they denied the signs of allāh and used to ridicule them allāh begins creation then he will repeat it then to him you will be returned and the day the hour appears the criminals will be in despair and there will not be for them among their partners any intercessors and they will be disbelievers in their partners and the day the hour appears that day they will become separated and as for those who had believed and done righteous deeds they will be in a garden delighted but as for those who disbelieved and denied our verses and the meeting of the hereafter those will be brought into the punishment so exalted is allāh when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning and to him is praise throughout the heavens and the earth and at night and when you are at noon he brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness and thus will you be brought out and of his signs is that he created you from dust then suddenly you were human beings dispersing and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them and he placed between you affection and mercy indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge and of his signs is your sleep by night and day and your seeking of his bounty indeed in that are signs for a people who listen and of his signs is he shows you the lightning fear and aspiration and he sends down rain from the sky by which he brings to life the earth after its lifelessness indeed in that are signs for a people who use reason and of his signs is that the heaven and earth stand by his command then when he calls you with a call from the earth immediately you will come forth and to him belongs whoever is in the heavens and earth all are to him devoutly obedient and it is he who begins creation then he repeats it and that is easier for him to him belongs the highest description in the heavens and earth and he is the exalted in might the wise he presents to you an example from yourselves do you have among those whom your right hands possess any partners in what we have provided for you so that you are equal therein would fear them as your fear of one another ? thus do we detail the verses for a people who use reason but those who wrong follow their desires without knowledge then who can guide one whom allāh has sent astray? and for them there are no helpers so direct your face toward the religion inclining to truth the fiṭrah of allāh upon which he has created people no change should there be in the creation of allāh that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know turning in repentance to him and fear him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with allāh of those who have divided their religion and become sects every faction rejoicing in what it has and when adversity touches the people they call upon their lord turning in repentance to him then when he lets them taste mercy from him at once a party of them associate others with their lord so that they will deny what we have granted them then enjoy yourselves for you are going to know or have we sent down to them an authority and it speaks of what they have been associating with him? and when we let the people taste mercy they rejoice therein but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth immediately they despair do they not see that allāh extends provision for whom he wills and restricts ?

exalted is he and high above what they associate with him corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by what the hands of people have earned so he may let them taste part of what they have done that perhaps they will return say ""travel through the land and observe how was the end of those before most of them were associators so direct your face toward the correct religion before a day comes from allāh of which there is no repelling that day they will be divided whoever disbelieves upon him is his disbelief and whoever does righteousness they are for themselves preparing that he may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds out of his bounty indeed he does not like the disbelievers and of his signs is that he sends the winds as bringers of good tidings and to let you taste his mercy and so the ships may sail at his command and so you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful and we have already sent messengers before you to their peoples and they came to them with clear evidences then we took retribution from those who committed crimes and incumbent upon us was support of the believers it is allāh who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however he wills and he makes them fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them and when he causes it to fall upon whom he wills of his servants immediately they rejoice although they were before it was sent down upon them before that in despair so observe the effects of the mercy of allāh how he gives life to the earth after its lifelessness indeed that will give life to the dead and he is over all things competent but if we should send a wind and they saw turned yellow they would remain thereafter disbelievers so indeed you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs retreating and you cannot guide the blind away from their error you will only make hear those who believe in our verses so they are muslims allāh is the one who created you from weakness then made after weakness strength then made after strength weakness and white hair he creates what he wills and he is the knowing the competent and the day the hour appears the criminals will swear they had remained but an hour thus they were deluded but those who were given knowledge and faith will say ""you remained the extent of allāh's decree until the day of resurrection and this is the day of resurrection but you did not used to know"" so that day their excuse will not benefit those who wronged nor will they be asked to appease and we have certainly presented to the people in this qur’ān from every example but if you should bring them a sign the disbelievers will surely say ""you are but falsifiers"" thus does allāh seal the hearts of those who do not know so be patient indeed the promise of allāh is truth and let them not disquiet you who are not certain"

man two hearts in his interior and he has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers and he has not made your claimed sons your sons that is your saying by your mouths but allāh says the truth and he guides to the way call them by their fathers it is more just in the sight of allāh but if you do not know their fathers then they are your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you and there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but what your hearts intended and ever is allāh forgiving and merciful the prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves and his wives are their mothers and those of relationship are more entitled in the decree of allāh than the believers and the emigrants except that you may do to your close associates a kindness that was in the book inscribed and when we took from the prophets their covenant and from you and from noah and abraham and moses and jesus the son of mary and we took from them a solemn covenant that he may question the truthful about their truth and he has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment o you who have believed remember the favor of allāh upon you when armies came to you and we sent upon them a wind and armies you did not see and ever is allāh of what you do seeing when they came at you from above you and from below you and when eyes shifted and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about allāh assumptions there the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said ""allāh and his messenger did not promise us except delusion"" and when a faction of them said ""o people of yathrib there is no stability for you so return "" and a party of them asked permission of the prophet saying ""indeed our houses are exposed "" while they were not exposed they did not intend except to flee and if they had been entered upon from all its regions and fitnah had been demanded of them they would have done it and not hesitated over it except briefly and they had already promised allāh before not to turn their backs and ever is the promise to allāh questioned say ""never will fleeing benefit you if you should flee from death or killing and then you would not be given enjoyment except for a little"" say ""who is it that can protect you from allāh if he intends for you an ill or intends for you a mercy?"" and they will not find for themselves besides allāh any protector or any helper already allāh knows the hinderers among you and those who say to their brothers ""come to us"" and do not go to

tongues indisposed toward good those have not believed so allāh has rendered their deeds worthless and ever is that for allāh easy they think the companies have not withdrawn and if the companies should come they would wish they were in the desert among the bedouins inquiring about your news and if they should be among you they would not fight except for a little there has certainly been for you in the messenger of allāh an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in allāh and the last day and remembers allāh often and when the believers saw the companies they said ""this is what allāh and his messenger had promised us and allāh and his messenger spoke the truth"" and it increased them only in faith and acceptance among the believers are men true to what they promised allāh among them is he who has fulfilled his vow and among them is he who awaits and they did not alter by any alteration that allāh may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if he wills

punishment would be doubled two fold and ever is that for allāh easy and whoever of you devoutly obeys allāh and his messenger and does righteousness we will give her her reward twice and we have prepared for her a noble provision o wives of the prophet you are not like anyone among women if you fear allāh then do not be soft in speech lest he in whose heart is disease should covet but speak with appropriate speech and abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as the display of the former times of ignorance and establish prayer and give zakāh and obey allāh and his messenger allāh intends only to remove from you the impurity o people of the household and to purify you with purification and remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of allāh and wisdom indeed

patient women the humble men and humble women the charitable men and charitable women the fasting men and fasting women the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so and the men who

matter that they should have any choice about their affair and whoever disobeys allāh and his messenger has certainly strayed into clear error and when you said to the one on whom allāh bestowed favor and you bestowed favor ""keep your wife and fear allāh"" while you concealed within yourself that which allāh is to disclose and you feared the people while allāh has more right that you fear him so when zayd had no longer any need for her we married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their claimed sons when they no longer have need of them and ever is the command of allāh accomplished there is not to be upon the prophet any discomfort concerning that which allāh has imposed upon him the established way of allāh with those who have

is not the father of one of your men but the messenger of allāh and seal of the prophets and ever is allāh of all things knowing o you who have believed remember allāh with much remembrance and exalt him morning and afternoon it is he who confers blessing upon you and his angels that he may bring you out from darknesses into the light and ever is he to the believers merciful their greeting the day they meet him will be ""peace"" and he has prepared for them a noble reward o prophet indeed we have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner and one who invites to allāh by his permission and an illuminating lamp and give good tidings to the believers that they will have from allāh great bounty and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites and disregard their annoyance and rely upon allāh and sufficient is allāh as disposer of affairs o you who have believed when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them so provide for them and give them a gracious release o prophet indeed we have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hand possesses from what allāh has returned to you and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the prophet if the prophet wishes to marry her only for you excluding the believers we certainly know what we have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess in order that there will be upon you no discomfort and ever is allāh forgiving and merciful you may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will and any that you desire of those from whom you had separated there is no blame upon you that is more suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them all of them and allāh knows what is in your hearts and ever is allāh knowing and forbearing not lawful to you are women after nor for you to exchange them for wives even if their beauty were to please you except what your right hand possesses and ever is allāh over all things an observer o you who have believed do not enter the houses of the prophet except when you are permitted for a meal without awaiting its readiness but when you are invited then enter and when you have eaten disperse without seeking to remain for conversation indeed that was troubling the prophet and he is shy of you but allāh is not shy of the truth and when you ask for something ask them from behind a partition that is purer for your hearts and their hearts and it is not for you to harm the messenger of allāh or to marry his wives after him ever indeed that would be in the sight of allāh an enormity whether you reveal a thing or conceal it indeed allāh is ever of all things knowing there is no blame upon them concerning their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers' sons or their sisters' sons or their women or those their right hands possess and fear allāh indeed allāh is ever over all things witness indeed allāh confers blessing upon the prophet and his angels o you who have believed ask blessing upon him and ask peace indeed those who abuse allāh and his messenger allāh has cursed them in this world and the hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment and those who harm believing men and believing women for other than what they have earned have certainly borne upon themselves a slander and manifest sin o prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments that is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused and ever is allāh forgiving and merciful if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in almadīnah do not cease we will surely incite you against them then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little accursed wherever they are found seized and massacred completely the established way of allāh with those who passed on before and you will not find in the way of allāh any change people ask you concerning the hour say ""knowledge of it is only with allāh and what may make you perceive? perhaps the hour is near"" indeed allāh has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a blaze abiding therein forever they will not find a protector or a helper the day their faces will be turned about in the fire they will say ""how we wish we had obeyed allāh and obeyed the messenger"" and they will say ""our lord indeed we obeyed our masters and our dignitaries and they led us astray from the way our lord give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse"" o you who have believed be not like those who abused moses then allāh cleared him of what they said and he in the sight of allāh was distinguished o you who have believed fear allāh and speak words of appropriate justice he will amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins and whoever obeys allāh and his messenger has certainly attained a great attainment indeed we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains and they declined to bear it and feared it but man bear it indeed he was unjust and ignorant was] so that allāh may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the men and women who associate others with him and that allāh may accept repentance from the believing men and believing women and ever is allāh forgiving and merciful"

has he invented about allāh a lie or is there in him madness?"" rather they who do not believe in the hereafter will be in the punishment and extreme error then do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth? if we should will we could cause the earth to swallow them or let fall upon them fragments from the sky indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back and we certainly gave david from us bounty ""o mountains repeat praises with him and the birds "" and we made pliable for him iron ""make full coats of mail and calculate the links and work righteousness indeed i of what you do am seeing"" and to solomon the wind its morning a month and its afternoon a month and we made flow for him a spring of copper and among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his lord and whoever deviated among them from our command we will make him taste of the punishment of the blaze they made for him what he willed of elevated chambers statues bowls like reservoirs and stationary kettles ""work o family of david in gratitude"" and few of my servants are grateful and when we decreed for him death nothing indicated to them his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff but when he fell it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen they would not have remained in humiliating punishment there was for saba’ in their dwelling place a sign two gardens on the right and on the left ""eat from the provisions of your lord and be grateful to him a good land and a forgiving lord"" but they turned away so we sent upon them the flood of the dam and we replaced their two gardens with gardens of bitter fruit tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees that we repaid them because they disbelieved and do we repay except the ungrateful? and we placed between them and the cities which we had blessed visible cities and we determined between them the journey ""travel between them by night or by day in safety"" but they said ""our lord lengthen the distance between our journeys"" and wronged themselves so we made them narrations and dispersed them in total dispersion indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful and iblees had already confirmed through them his assumption so they followed him except for a party of believers and he had over them no authority except that we might make evident who believes in the hereafter from who is thereof in doubt and your lord over all things is guardian say ""invoke those you claim besides allāh"" they do not possess an atom's weight in the heavens or on the earth and they do not have therein any partnership nor is there for him from among them any assistant and intercession does not benefit with him except for one whom he permits until when terror is removed from their hearts they will say ""what has your lord said?"" they will say ""the truth"" and he is the most high the grand say ""who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?"" say ""allāh and indeed we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error"" say ""you will not be asked about what we committed and we will not be asked about what you do"" say ""our lord will bring us together then he will judge between us in truth and he is the knowing judge"" say ""show me those whom you have attached to him as partners no! rather he is allāh the exalted in might the wise"" and we have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner but most of the people do not know and they say ""when is this promise if you should be truthful?"" say ""for you is the appointment of a day you will not remain thereafter an hour nor will you precede "" and those who disbelieve say ""we will never believe in this qur’ān nor in that before it"" but if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their lord refuting each others' words those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant ""if not for you we would have been believers"" those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed ""did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you? rather you were criminals"" those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant ""rather conspiracy of night and day when you were ordering us to disbelieve in allāh and attribute to him equals"" but they will confide regret when they see the punishment and we will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved will they be recompensed except for what they used to do? and we did not send into a city any warner except that its affluent said ""indeed we in that with which you were sent are disbelievers"" and they said ""we are more in wealth and children and we are not to be punished"" say ""indeed my lord extends provision for whom he wills and restricts but most of the people do not know"" and it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to us in position but it is one who has believed and done righteousness for them there will be the double reward for what they did and they will be in the upper chambers safe and the ones who strive against our verses to cause failure those will be brought into the punishment say ""indeed my lord extends provision for whom he wills of his servants and restricts for him but whatever thing you spend  he will compensate it and he is the best of providers"" and the day when he will gather them all and then say to the angels ""did these used to worship you?"" they will say ""exalted are you! you are our benefactor excluding them rather they used to worship the jinn most of them were believers in them"" but today you do not hold for one another benefit or harm and we will say to those who wronged ""taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny"" and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences they say ""this is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that which your fathers were worshipping"" and they say ""this is not except a lie invented"" and those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them ""this is not but obvious magic"" and we had not given them any scriptures which they could study and we had not sent to them before you any warner and those before them denied and they have not attained a tenth of what we had given them but they denied my messengers so how was my reproach say ""i only advise you of one  that you stand for allāh in pairs and individually and then give thought"" there is not in your companion any madness he is only a warner to you before a severe punishment say ""whatever payment i might have asked of you it is yours my payment is only from allāh and he is over all things witness"" say ""indeed my lord projects the truth knower of the unseen"" say ""the truth has come and falsehood can neither begin nor repeat "" say ""if i should err i would only err against myself but if i am guided it is by what my lord reveals to me indeed he is hearing and near"" and if you could see when they are terrified but there is no escape and they will be seized from a place nearby and they will say ""we believe in it!"" but how for them will be the taking from a place far away? and they had already disbelieved in it before and would assault the unseen from a place far away and prevention will be placed between them and what they desire as was done with their kind before indeed they were in disquieting doubt"
35,31.82608695652174,1464,46,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful praise is to allāh creator of the heavens and the earth made the angels messengers having wings two or three or four he increases in creation what he wills indeed allāh is over all things competent whatever allāh grants to people of mercy none can withhold it and whatever he withholds none can release it thereafter and he is the exalted in might the wise o mankind remember the favor of allāh upon you is there any creator other than allāh who provides for you from the heaven and earth? there is no deity except him so how are you deluded? and if they deny you  already were messengers denied before you and to allāh are returned matters o mankind indeed the promise of allāh is truth so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about allāh by the deceiver indeed satan is an enemy to you so take him as an enemy he only invites his party to be among the companions of the blaze those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment and those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and great reward then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good ? for indeed allāh sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills so do not let yourself perish over them in regret indeed allāh is knowing of what they do and it is allāh who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and we drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness thus is the resurrection whoever desires honor  then to allāh belongs all honor to him ascends good speech and righteous work raises it but they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment and the plotting of those it will perish and allāh created you from dust then from a spermdrop then he made you mates and no female conceives nor does she give birth except with his knowledge and no aged person is granted life nor is his lifespan lessened but that it is in a register indeed that for allāh is easy and not alike are the two seas one is fresh and sweet palatable for drinking and one is salty and bitter and from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowing through that you might seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful he causes the night to enter the day and he causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running for a specified term that is allāh your lord to him belongs sovereignty and those whom you invoke other than him do not possess the membrane of a date seed if you invoke them they do not hear your supplication and if they heard they would not respond to you and on the day of resurrection they will deny your association and none can inform you like aware o mankind you are those in need of allāh while allāh is the free of need the praiseworthy if he wills he can do away with you and bring forth a new creation and that is for allāh not difficult and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another and if a heavily laden soul calls to its load nothing of it will be carried even if he should be a close relative you can only warn those who fear their lord unseen and have established prayer and whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for his soul and to allāh is the destination not equal are the blind and the seeing nor are the darknesses and the light nor are the shade and the heat and not equal are the living and the dead indeed allāh causes to hear whom he wills but you cannot make hear those in the graves you are not but a warner indeed we have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner and there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner and if they deny you then already have those before them denied their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening scripture then i seized the ones who disbelieved and how was my reproach do you not see that allāh sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby fruits of varying colors? and in the mountains are tracts white and red of varying shades and extremely black and among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly only those fear allāh from among his servants who have knowledge indeed allāh is exalted in might and forgiving indeed those who recite the book of allāh and establish prayer and spend out of what we have provided them secretly and publicly expect a transaction that will never perish that he may give them in full their rewards and increase for them of his bounty indeed he is forgiving and appreciative and that which we have revealed to you of the book is the truth confirming what was before it indeed allāh of his servants is aware and seeing then we caused to inherit the book those we have chosen of our servants and among them is he who wrongs himself and among them is he who is moderate and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of allāh that is what is the great bounty gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be silk and they will say ""praise to allāh who has removed from us sorrow indeed our lord is forgiving and appreciative he who has settled us in the home of duration out of his bounty there touches us not in it any fatigue and there touches us not in it weariness "" and for those who disbelieve will be the fire of hell is not decreed for them so they may die nor will its torment be lightened for them thus do we recompense every ungrateful one and they will cry out therein ""our lord remove us we will do righteousness other than what we were doing!"" but did we not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember and the warner had come to you? so taste for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper indeed allāh is knower of the unseen of the heavens and earth indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts it is he who has made you successors upon the earth and whoever disbelieves upon him will be his disbelief and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their lord except in hatred and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss say ""have you considered your 'partners' whom you invoke besides allāh? show me what they have created from the earth or have they partnership in the heavens? or have we given them a book so they are on evidence therefrom? rather the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion"" indeed allāh holds the heavens and the earth lest they cease and if they should cease no one could hold them after him indeed he is forbearing and forgiving and they swore by allāh their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them they would be more guided than one of the nations but when a warner came to them it did not increase them except in aversion arrogance in the land and plotting of evil but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people then do they await except the way of the former peoples? but you will never find in the way of allāh any change and you will never find in the way of allāh any alteration have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? and they were greater than them in power but allāh is not to be caused failure by anything in the heavens or on the earth indeed he is ever knowing and competent and if allāh were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned he would not leave upon it any creature but he defers them for a specified term and when their time comes then indeed allāh has ever been of his servants seeing"

and indeed jonah was among the messengers when he ran away to the laden ship and he drew lots and was among the losers then the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy and had he not been of those who exalt allāh he would have remained inside its belly until the day they are resurrected but we threw him onto the open shore while he was ill and we caused to grow over him a gourd vine and we sent him to a hundred thousand or more and they believed so we gave them enjoyment for a time so inquire of them ""does your lord have daughters while they have sons? or did we create the angels as females while they were witnesses?"" unquestionably it is out of their falsehood that they say ""allāh has begotten"" and indeed they are liars has he chosen daughters over sons?

they said ""fear not two adversaries one of whom has wronged the other so judge between us with truth and do not exceed and guide us to the sound path indeed this my brother has ninetynine ewes and i have one ewe so he said 'entrust her to me' and he overpowered me in speech"" said ""he has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe to his ewes and indeed many associates oppress one another except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and few are they"" and david became certain that we had tried him and he asked forgiveness of his lord and fell down bowing and turned in repentance so we forgave him that and indeed for him is nearness to us and a good place of return ""o david indeed we have made you a successor upon the earth so judge between the people in truth and do not follow desire as it will lead you astray from the way of allāh"" indeed those who go astray from the way of allāh will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the day of account and we did not create the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly that is the assumption of those who disbelieve so woe to those who disbelieve from the fire or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land?

if you disbelieve indeed allāh is free from need of you and he does not approve for his servants disbelief and if you are grateful he approves it for you and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return and he will inform you about what you used to do indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts and when adversity touches man he calls upon his lord turning to him then when he bestows on him a favor from himself he forgets him whom he called upon before and he attributes to allāh equals to mislead from his way say ""enjoy your disbelief for a little indeed you are of the companions of the fire"" is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night prostrating and standing fearing the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord ? say ""are those who know equal to those who do not know?"" only they will remember people of understanding say ""o my servants who have believed fear your lord for those who do good in this world is good and the earth of allāh is spacious indeed the patient will be given their reward without account "" say ""indeed i have been commanded to worship allāh sincere to him in religion and i have been commanded to be the first of the muslims"" say ""indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day"" say ""allāh do i worship sincere to him in my religion so worship what you will besides him"" say ""indeed the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection unquestionably that is the manifest loss"" they will have canopies of fire above them and below them canopies by that allāh threatens his servants o my servants then fear me but those who have avoided ṭāghūt lest they worship it and turned back to allāh for them are good tidings so give good tidings to my servants who listen to speech and follow the best of it those are the ones allāh has guided and those are people of understanding then is one who has deserved the decree of punishment ? then can you save one who is in the fire? but those who have feared their lord for them are chambers above them chambers built high beneath which rivers flow the promise of allāh allāh does not fail in promise do you not see that allāh sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs in the earth then he produces thereby crops of varying colors then they dry and you see them turned yellow then he makes them debris indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding so is one whose breast allāh has expanded to islām and he is upon a light from his lord ? then woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of allāh those are in manifest error allāh has sent down the best statement a consistent book wherein is reiteration the skins shiver therefrom of those who fear their lord then their skins and their hearts relax at the remembrance of allāh that is the guidance of allāh by which he guides whom he wills and one whom allāh sends astray for him there is no guide then is he who will shield with his face the worst of the punishment on the day of resurrection ? and it will be said to the wrongdoers ""taste what you used to earn"" those before them denied and punishment came upon them from where they did not perceive so allāh made them taste disgrace in worldly life but the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they only knew and we have certainly presented for the people in this qur’ān from every example that they might remember an arabic qur’ān without any deviance that they might become righteous allāh presents an example a man owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man are they equal in comparison? praise be to allāh! but most of them do not know indeed you are to die and indeed they are to die then indeed you on the day of resurrection before your lord will dispute so who is more unjust than one who lies about allāh and denies the truth when it has come to him? is there not in hell a residence for the disbelievers? and the one who has brought the truth and believed in it those are the righteous they will have whatever they desire with their lord that is the reward of the doers of good that allāh may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them their due for the best of what they used to do is not allāh sufficient for his servant ? and they threaten you with those other than him and whoever allāh leaves astray for him there is no guide and whoever allāh guides for him there is no misleader is not allāh exalted in might and owner of retribution? and if you asked them ""who created the heavens and the earth?"" they would surely say ""allāh"" say ""then have you considered what you invoke besides allāh? if allāh intended me harm are they removers of his harm or if he intended me mercy are they withholders of his mercy?"" say ""sufficient for me is allāh upon him rely the reliers"" say ""o my people work according to your position indeed i am working and you are going to know to whom will come a torment disgracing him and on whom will descend an enduring punishment"" indeed we sent down to you the book for the people in truth so whoever is guided it is for his soul and whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment and you are not a manager over them allāh takes the souls at the time of their death and those that do not die during their sleep then he keeps those for which he has decreed death and releases the others for a specified term indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought or have they taken other than allāh as intercessors? say ""even though they do not possess anything nor do they reason?"" say ""to allāh belongs intercession entirely to him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth then to him you will be returned"" and when allāh is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with aversion but when those other than him are mentioned immediately they rejoice say ""o allāh creator of the heavens and the earth knower of the unseen and the witnessed you will judge between your servants concerning that over which they used to differ"" and if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it they would ransom themselves thereby from the worst of the punishment on the day of resurrection and there will appear to them from allāh that which they had not taken into account and there will appear to them the evils they had earned and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule and when adversity touches man he calls upon us then when we bestow on him a favor from us he says ""i have only been given it because of knowledge"" rather it is a trial but most of them do not know those before them had already said it but they were not availed by what they used to earn and the evil consequences of what they earned struck them and those who have wronged of these will be struck by the evil consequences of what they earned and they will not cause failure do they not know that allāh extends provision for whom he wills and restricts ? indeed in that are signs for a people who believe say ""o my servants who have transgressed against themselves do not despair of the mercy of allāh indeed allāh forgives all sins indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful"" and return to your lord and submit to him before the punishment comes upon you then you will not be helped and follow the best of what was revealed to you from your lord before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you do not perceive lest a soul should say ""oh my regret over what i neglected in regard to allāh and that i was among the mockers"" or it say ""if only allāh had guided me i would have been among the righteous"" or it say when it sees the punishment ""if only i had another turn so i could be among the doers of good"" but yes there had come to you my verses but you denied them and were arrogant and you were among the disbelievers and on the day of resurrection you will see those who lied about allāh their faces blackened is there not in hell a residence for the arrogant? and allāh will save those who feared him by their attainment no evil will touch them nor will they grieve allāh is the creator of all things and he is over all things disposer of affairs to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth and they who disbelieve in the verses of allāh it is those who are the losers say ""is it other than allāh that you order me to worship o ignorant ones?"" and it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate with allāh your work would surely become worthless and you would surely be among the losers rather worship allāh and be among the grateful they have not appraised allāh with true appraisal while the earth entirely will be his grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens will be folded in his right hand exalted is he and high above what they associate with him and the horn will be blown and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom allāh wills then it will be blown again and at once they will be standing looking on and the earth will shine with the light of its lord and the record will be placed and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and it will be judged between them in truth and they will not be wronged and every soul will be fully compensated what it did and he is most knowing of what they do and those who disbelieved will be driven to hell in groups until when they reach it its gates are opened and its keepers will say ""did there not come to you messengers from yourselves reciting to you the verses of your lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours?"" they will say ""yes but the word of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers"" it will be said ""enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and wretched is the residence of the arrogant"" but those who feared their lord will be driven to paradise in groups until when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say ""peace be upon you you have become pure so enter it to abide eternally therein"" and they will say ""praise to allāh who has fulfilled for us his promise and made us inherit the earth we may settle in paradise wherever we will and excellent is the reward of workers"" and you will see the angels surrounding the throne exalting with praise of their lord and it will be judged between them in truth and it will be said "" praise to allāh lord of the worlds"""

but they were rejecting our signs so we sent upon them a screaming wind during days of misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life but the punishment of the hereafter is more disgracing and they will not be helped and as for thamūd we guided them but they preferred blindness over guidance so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn and we saved those who believed and used to fear allāh and the day when the enemies of allāh will be gathered to the fire while they are assembled in rows until when they reach it their hearing and their eyes and their skins will testify against them of what they used to do and they will say to their skins ""why have you testified against us?"" they will say ""we were made to speak by allāh who has made everything speak and he created you the first time and to him you are returned and you were not covering yourselves lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins but you assumed that allāh does not know much of what you do and that was your assumption which you assumed about your lord it has brought you to ruin and you have become among the losers"" so if they are patient the fire is a residence for them and if they ask to appease they will not be of those who are allowed to appease and we appointed for them companions who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them and the word has come into effect upon them among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men indeed they were losers and those who disbelieve say ""do not listen to this qur’ān and speak noisily during it that perhaps you will overcome"" but we will surely cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe punishment and we will surely recompense them for the worst of what they had been doing that is the recompense of the enemies of allāh the fire for them therein is the home of eternity as recompense for what they of our verses were rejecting and those who disbelieved will say ""our lord show us those who misled us of the jinn and men we may put them under our feet that they will be among the lowest"" indeed those who have said ""our lord is allāh"" and then remained on a right course the angels will descend upon them ""do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of paradise which you were promised we were your allies in worldly life and in the hereafter and you will have therein whatever your souls desire and you will have therein whatever you request as accommodation from a forgiving and merciful"" and who is better in speech than one who invites to allāh and does righteousness and says ""indeed i am of the muslims"" and not equal are the good deed and the bad repel by that which is better and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity as though he was a devoted friend but none is granted it except those who are patient and none is granted it except one having a great portion and if there comes to you from satan an evil suggestion then seek refuge in allāh indeed he is the hearing the knowing and of his signs are the night and day and the sun and moon do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon but prostrate to allāh who created them if it should be him that you worship but if they are arrogant then those who are near your lord exalt him by night and by day and they do not become weary and of his signs is that you see the earth stilled but when we send down upon it rain it quivers and grows indeed he who has given it life is the giver of life to the dead indeed he is over all things competent indeed those who inject deviation into our verses are not concealed from us so is he who is cast into the fire better or he who comes secure on the day of resurrection? do whatever you will indeed he is seeing of what you do indeed those who disbelieve in the message after it has come to them and indeed it is a mighty book falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it a revelation from a wise and praiseworthy nothing is said to you except what was already said to the messengers before you indeed your lord is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty and if we had made it a foreign qur’ān they would have said ""why are its verses not explained in detail ? is it a foreign and an arab ?"" say ""it is for those who believe a guidance and cure"" and those who do not believe in their ears is deafness and it is upon them blindness those are being called from a distant place and we had already given moses the scripture but it came under disagreement and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been concluded between them and indeed they are concerning it in disquieting doubt whoever does righteousness it is for his soul and whoever does evil against it and your lord is not ever unjust to servants to him is attributed knowledge of the hour and fruits emerge not from their coverings nor does a female conceive or give birth except with his knowledge and the day he will call to them ""where are my 'partners'?"" they will say ""we announce to you that there is among us any witness "" and lost from them will be those they were invoking before and they will be certain that they have no place of escape man is not weary of supplication for good but if evil touches him he is hopeless and despairing and if we let him taste mercy from us after an adversity which has touched him he will surely say ""this is to me and i do not think the hour will occur and if i should be returned to my lord indeed for me there will be with him the best"" but we will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did and we will surely make them taste a massive punishment and when we bestow favor upon man he turns away and distances himself but when evil touches him then he is full of extensive supplication say ""have you considered if it is from allāh and you disbelieved in it who would be more astray than one who is in extreme dissension?"" we will show them our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth but is it not sufficient concerning your lord that he is over all things a witness? unquestionably they are in doubt about the meeting with their lord unquestionably he is of all things encompassing"
42,29.85185185185185,1612,54,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful ḥā meem ʿayn seen qāf thus has he revealed to you and to those before you allāh the exalted in might the wise to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and he is the most high the most great the heavens almost break from above them and the angels exalt with praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth unquestionably it is allāh who is the forgiving the merciful and those who take as allies other than him allāh is guardian over them and you are not over them a manager and thus we have revealed to you an arabic qur’ān that you may warn the mother of cities and those around it and warn of the day of assembly about which there is no doubt a party will be in paradise and a party in the blaze and if allāh willed he could have made them one religion but he admits whom he wills into his mercy and the wrongdoers have not any protector or helper or have they taken protectors besides him? but allāh he is the protector and he gives life to the dead and he is over all things competent and in anything over which you disagree its ruling is to allāh ""that is allāh my lord upon him i have relied and to him i turn back"" creator of the heavens and the earth he has made for you from yourselves mates and among the cattle mates he multiplies you thereby there is nothing like unto him and he is the hearing the seeing to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth he extends provision for whom he wills and restricts indeed he is of all things knowing he has ordained for you of religion what he enjoined upon noah and that which we have revealed to you and what we enjoined upon abraham and moses and jesus to establish the religion and not be divided therein difficult for those who associate others with allāh is that to which you invite them allāh chooses for himself whom he wills and guides to himself whoever turns back and they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves and if not for a word that preceded from your lord until a specified time it would have been concluded between them and indeed those who were granted inheritance of the scripture after them are concerning it in disquieting doubt so to that invite and remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not follow their inclinations but say ""i have believed in what allāh has revealed of scripture and i have been commanded to do justice among you allāh is our lord and your lord for us are our deeds and for you your deeds there is no argument between us and you allāh will bring us together and to him is the destination"" and those who argue concerning allāh after he has been responded to their argument is invalid with their lord and upon them is wrath and for them is a severe punishment it is allāh who has sent down the book in truth and the balance and what will make you perceive? perhaps the hour is near those who do not believe in it are impatient for it but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth unquestionably those who dispute concerning the hour are in extreme error allāh is subtle with his servants he gives provision to whom he wills and he is the powerful the exalted in might whoever desires the harvest of the hereafter we increase for him in his harvest and whoever desires the harvest of this world we give him thereof but there is not for him in the hereafter any share or have they partners who have ordained for them a religion to which allāh has not consented? but if not for the decisive word it would have been concluded between them and indeed the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment you will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned and it will befall them and those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens having whatever they will in the presence of their lord that is what is the great bounty it is that of which allāh gives good tidings to his servants who believe and do righteous deeds say ""i do not ask you for it any payment only good will through kinship"" and whoever commits a good deed we will increase for him good therein indeed allāh is forgiving and appreciative or do they say ""he has invented about allāh a lie""? but if allāh willed he could seal over your heart and allāh eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by his words indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts and it is he who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons misdeeds and he knows what you do and he answers those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases them from his bounty but the disbelievers will have a severe punishment and if allāh had extended provision for his servants they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth but he sends down in an amount which he wills indeed he is of his servants aware and seeing and it is he who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads his mercy and he is the protector the praiseworthy and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what he has dispersed throughout them of creatures and he for gathering them when he wills is competent and whatever strikes you of disaster it is for what your hands have earned but he pardons much and you will not cause failure upon the earth and you have not besides allāh any protector or helper and of his signs are the ships in the sea like mountains if he willed he could still the wind and they would remain motionless on its surface indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful or he could destroy them for what they earned but he pardons much and those who dispute concerning our signs may know that for them there is no place of escape so whatever thing you have been given it is but enjoyment of the worldly life but what is with allāh is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their lord rely and those who avoid the major sins and immoralities and when they are angry they forgive and those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is consultation among themselves and from what we have provided them they spend and those who when tyranny strikes them they retaliate and the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation his reward is from allāh indeed he does not like wrongdoers and whoever retaliates after having been wronged those have not upon them any cause the cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right those will have a painful punishment and whoever is patient and forgives indeed that is of the matters of resolve and he whom allāh sends astray for him there is no protector beyond him and you will see the wrongdoers when they see the punishment saying ""is there for return any way?"" and you will see them being exposed to it humbled from humiliation looking from a covert glance and those who had believed will say ""indeed the losers are the ones who lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection unquestionably the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment"" and there will not be for them any allies to aid them other than allāh and whoever allāh sends astray for him there is no way respond to your lord before a day comes from allāh of which there is no repelling no refuge will you have that day nor for you will there be any denial but if they turn away then we have not sent you over them as a guardian upon you is only notification and indeed when we let man taste mercy from us he rejoices in it but if evil afflicts him for what his hands have put forth then indeed man is ungrateful to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he creates what he wills he gives to whom he wills female and he gives to whom he wills males or he makes them males and females and he renders whom he wills barren indeed he is knowing and competent and it is not for any human being that allāh should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that he sends a messenger to reveal by his permission what he wills indeed he is most high and wise and thus we have revealed to you an inspiration of our command you did not know what is the book or faith but we have made it a light by which we guide whom we will of our servants and indeed you guide to a straight path the path of allāh to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth unquestionably to allāh do matters evolve"
43,18.933333333333334,1704,90,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful ḥā meem by the clear book indeed we have made it an arabic qur’ān that you might understand and indeed it is in the mother of the book with us exalted and full of wisdom then should we turn the message away disregarding you because you are a transgressing people? and how many a prophet we sent among the former peoples but there would not come to them a prophet except that they used to ridicule him and we destroyed greater than them in power and the example of the former peoples has preceded and if you should ask them ""who has created the heavens and the earth?"" they would surely say ""they were created by the exalted in might the knowing"" who has made for you the earth a bed and made for you upon it roads that you might be guided and who sends down rain from the sky in measured amounts and we revive thereby a dead land thus will you be brought forth and who created the species all of them and has made for you of ships and animals those which you mount that you may settle yourselves upon their backs and then remember the favor of your lord when you have settled upon them and say ""exalted is he who has subjected this to us and we could not have subdued it and indeed we to our lord will return"" but they have attributed to him from his servants a portion indeed man is clearly ungrateful or has he taken out of what he has created daughters and chosen you for sons? and when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attributes to the most merciful in comparison his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief so is one brought up in ornaments while being during conflict unevident ? and they described the angels who are servants of the most merciful as females did they witness their creation? their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned and they said ""if the most merciful had willed we would not have worshipped them"" they have of that no knowledge they are not but misjudging or have we given them a book before it to which they are adhering? rather they say ""indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps guided"" and similarly we did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said ""indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps following"" said ""even if i brought you better guidance than that upon which you found your fathers?"" they said ""indeed we in that with which you were sent are disbelievers"" so we took retribution from them then see how was the end of the deniers and when abraham said to his father and his people ""indeed i am disassociated from that which you worship except for he who created me and indeed he will guide me"" and he made it a word remaining among his descendants that they might return however i gave enjoyment to these and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a clear messenger but when the truth came to them they said ""this is magic and indeed we are concerning it disbelievers"" and they said ""why was this qur’ān not sent down upon a great man from the two cities?"" do they distribute the mercy of your lord? it is we who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees that they may make use of one another for service but the mercy of your lord is better than whatever they accumulate and if it were not that the people would become one community we would have made for those who disbelieve in the most merciful for their houses ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount and for their houses doors and couches upon which to recline and gold ornament but all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life and the hereafter with your lord is for the righteous and whoever is blinded from remembrance of the most merciful we appoint for him a devil and he is to him a companion and indeed they avert them from the way while they think that they are guided until when he comes to us he says ""how i wish there was between me and you the distance between the east and west and what a wretched companion"" and never will it benefit you that day when you have wronged that you are sharing in the punishment then will you make the deaf hear or guide the blind or he who is in clear error? and whether we take you away indeed we will take retribution upon them or whether we show you that which we have promised them indeed we are perfect in ability so adhere to that which is revealed to you indeed you are on a straight path and indeed it is a remembrance for you and your people and you are going to be questioned and ask those we sent before you of our messengers have we made besides the most merciful deities to be worshipped? and certainly did we send moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment and he said ""indeed i am the messenger of the lord of the worlds"" but when he brought them our signs at once they laughed at them and we showed them not a sign except that it was greater than its sister and we seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return and they said ""o magician invoke for us your lord by what he has promised you indeed we will be guided"" but when we removed from them the affliction at once they broke their word and pharaoh called out among his people he said ""o my people does not the kingdom of egypt belong to me and these rivers flowing beneath me then do you not see? or am i better than this one who is insignificant and hardly makes himself clear? then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of gold or come with him the angels in conjunction?"" so he bluffed his people and they obeyed him indeed they were a people defiantly disobedient and when they angered us we took retribution from them and drowned them all and we made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples and when the son of mary was presented as an example immediately your people laughed aloud and they said ""are our gods better or is he?"" they did not present it except for argument but they are a people prone to dispute he was not but a servant upon whom we bestowed favor and we made him an example for the children of israel and if we willed we could have made of you angels succeeding on the earth and indeed he will be knowledge of the hour so be not in doubt of it and follow me this is a straight path and never let satan avert you indeed he is to you a clear enemy and when jesus brought clear proofs he said ""i have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ so fear allāh and obey me indeed allāh is my lord and your lord so worship him this is a straight path"" but the denominations from among them differed so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a painful day are they waiting except for the hour to come upon them suddenly while they perceive not? close friends that day will be enemies to each other except for the righteous ""o my servants no fear will there be concerning you this day nor will you grieve who believed in our verses and were muslims enter paradise you and your kinds delighted"" circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold and therein is whatever the souls desire and delights the eyes and you will abide therein eternally and that is paradise which you are made to inherit for what you used to do for you therein is much fruit from which you will eat indeed the criminals will be in the punishment of hell abiding eternally it will not be allowed to subside for them and they therein are in despair and we did not wrong them but it was they who were the wrongdoers and they will call ""o mālik let your lord put an end to us!"" he will say ""indeed you will remain"" we had certainly brought you the truth but most of you to the truth were averse or have they devised affair? but indeed we are devising or do they think that we hear not their secrets and their private conversations? yes and our messengers are with them recording say ""if the most merciful had a son then i would be the first of worshippers"" exalted is the lord of the heavens and the earth lord of the throne above what they describe so leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their day which they are promised and it is he who is deity in the heaven and on the earth deity and he is the wise the knowing and blessed is he to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with whom is knowledge of the hour and to whom you will be returned and those they invoke besides him do not possess intercession but only those who testify to the truth and they know and if you asked them who created them they would surely say ""allāh"" so how are they deluded? and his saying ""o my lord indeed these are a people who do not believe"" so turn aside from them and say ""peace"" but they are going to know"

woe to every sinful liar who hears the verses of allāh recited to him then persists arrogantly as if he had not heard them so give him tidings of a painful punishment and when he knows anything of our verses he takes them in ridicule those will have a humiliating punishment before them is hell and what they had earned will not avail them at all nor what they had taken besides allāh as allies and they will have a great punishment this is guidance and those who have disbelieved in the verses of their lord will have a painful punishment of foul nature it is allāh who subjected to you the sea so that ships may sail upon it by his command and that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful and he has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth all from him indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought say to those who have believed that they forgive those who expect not the days of allāh so that he may recompense a people for what they used to earn whoever does a good deed it is for himself and whoever does evil it is against it then to your lord you will be returned and we did certainly give the children of israel the scripture and judgement and prophethood and we provided them with good things and preferred them over the worlds and we gave them clear proofs of the matter and they did not differ except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ then we put you on an ordained way concerning the matter so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know indeed they will never avail you against allāh at all and indeed the wrongdoers are allies of one another but allāh is the protector of the righteous this is enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain or do those who commit evils think we will make them like those who have believed and done righteous deeds  equal in their life and their death? evil is that which they judge and allāh created the heavens and earth in truth and so that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned and they will not be wronged have you seen he who has taken as his god his desire and allāh has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil? so who will guide him after allāh? then will you not be reminded? and they say ""there is not but our worldly life we die and live and nothing destroys us except time"" and they have of that no knowledge they are only assuming and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences their argument is only that they say ""bring our forefathers if you should be truthful"" say ""allāh causes you to live then causes you to die then he will assemble you for the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt but most of the people do not know"" and to allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and the day the hour appears that day the falsifiers will lose and you will see every nation kneeling every nation will be called to its record ""today you will be recompensed for what you used to do this our record speaks about you in truth indeed we were having transcribed whatever you used to do"" so as for those who believed and did righteous deeds their lord will admit them into his mercy that is what is the clear attainment but as for those who disbelieved ""were not our verses recited to you but you were arrogant and became a criminal people?

then bring us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful"" he said ""knowledge is only with allāh and i convey to you that with which i was sent but i see you a people behaving ignorantly"" and when they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys they said ""this is a cloud bringing us rain!"" rather it is that for which you were impatient a wind within it a painful punishment destroying everything by command of its lord and they became so that nothing was seen except their dwellings thus do we recompense the criminal people and we had certainly established them in such as we have not established you and we made for them hearing and vision and hearts but their hearing and vision and hearts availed them not from anything when they were rejecting the signs of allāh and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule and we have already destroyed what surrounds you of cities and we have diversified the signs that perhaps they might return then why did those they took besides allāh as deities by which to approach not aid them? but they had strayed from them and that was their falsehood and what they were inventing and when we directed to you a few of the jinn listening to the qur’ān and when they attended it they said ""listen attentively"" and when it was concluded they went back to their people as warners they said ""o our people indeed we have heard a book revealed after moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path o our people respond to the caller of allāh and believe in him he will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment but he who does not respond to the caller of allāh will not cause failure upon earth and he will not have besides him any protectors those are in manifest error"" do they not see that allāh who created the heavens and earth and did not fail in their creation is able to give life to the dead? yes indeed he is over all things competent and the day those who disbelieved are exposed to the fire ""is this not the truth?"" they will say ""yes by our lord"" he will say ""then taste the punishment for what you used to deny"" so be patient as were those of determination among the messengers and do not be impatient for them it will be on the day they see that which they are promised as though they had not remained except an hour of a day notification and will be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people?"
47,26.76923076923077,1044,39,"in the name of allāh the entirely merciful the especially merciful those who disbelieve and avert from the way of allāh he will waste their deeds and those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down upon muḥammad and it is the truth from their lord he will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus does allāh present to the people their comparisons so when you meet those who disbelieve strike necks until when you have inflicted slaughter upon them then secure bonds and either favor afterwards or ransom until the war lays down its burdens that and if allāh had willed he could have taken vengeance upon them but to test some of you by means of others and those who are killed in the cause of allāh never will he waste their deeds he will guide them and amend their condition and admit them to paradise which he has made known to them o you who have believed if you support allāh he will support you and plant firmly your feet but those who disbelieve for them is misery and he will waste their deeds that is because they disliked what allāh revealed so he rendered worthless their deeds have they not traveled through the land and seen how was the end of those before them? allāh destroyed over them and for the disbelievers is something comparable that is because allāh is the protector of those who have believed and because the disbelievers have no protector indeed allāh will admit those who have believed and done righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock eat and the fire will be a residence for them and how many a city was stronger than your city which drove you out? we destroyed them and there was no helper for them so is he who is on clear evidence from his lord like him to whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they follow their desires? is the description of paradise which the righteous are promised wherein are rivers of water unaltered rivers of milk the taste of which never changes rivers of wine delicious to those who drink and rivers of purified honey in which they will have from all fruits and forgiveness from their lord like those who abide eternally in the fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines? and among them are those who listen to you until when they depart from you they say to those who were given knowledge ""what has he said just now?"" those are the ones of whom allāh has sealed over their hearts and who have followed their desires and those who are guided he increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness then do they await except that the hour should come upon them unexpectedly? but already there have come its indications then how to them when it has come will be their remembrance? so know that there is no deity except allāh and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women and allāh knows of your movement and your resting place those who believe say ""why has a sūrah not been sent down?"" but when a precise sūrah is revealed and battle is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is disease looking at you with a look of one overcome by death and more appropriate for them obedience and good words and when the matter was determined if they had been true to allāh it would have been better for them so would you perhaps if you turned away cause corruption on earth and sever your relationship? those are the ones that allāh has cursed so he deafened them and blinded their vision then do they not reflect upon the qur’ān or are there locks upon hearts? indeed those who reverted back after guidance had become clear to them satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them that is because they said to those who disliked what allāh sent down ""we will obey you in part of the matter"" and allāh knows what they conceal then how when the angels take them in death striking their faces and their backs? that is because they followed what angered allāh and disliked his pleasure so he rendered worthless their deeds or do those in whose hearts is disease think that allāh would never expose their hatred? and if we willed we could show them to you and you would know them by their mark but you will surely know them by the tone of speech and allāh knows your deeds and we will surely test you until we make evident those who strive among you and the patient and we will test your affairs indeed those who disbelieved and averted from the path of allāh and opposed the messenger after guidance had become clear to them never will they harm allāh at all and he will render worthless their deeds o you who have believed obey allāh and obey the messenger and do not invalidate your deeds indeed those who disbelieved and averted from the path of allāh and then died while they were disbelievers never will allāh forgive them so do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior and allāh is with you and will never deprive you of your deeds worldly life is only amusement and diversion and if you believe and fear allāh he will give you your rewards and not ask you for your properties if he should ask you for them and press you you would withhold and he would expose your hatred here you are those invited to spend in the cause of allāh but among you are those who withhold and whoever withholds only withholds from himself and allāh is the free of need while you are the needy and if you turn away he will replace you with another people then they will not be the likes of you"
